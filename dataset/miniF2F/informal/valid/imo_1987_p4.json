If $k = 2h$, then we may take $f(n) = n + h$. \n\nSuppose $f(m) = n$ with $m \\equiv n \\mod k$. Then by an easy induction on $r$ we find $f(m + kr) = n + kr$, $f(n + kr) = m + k(r+1)$. We show this leads to a contradiction. Suppose $m < n$, so $n = m + ks$ for some $s > 0$. Then $f(n) = f(m + ks) = n + ks$. But $f(n) = m + k$, so $m = n + k(s - 1) \\ge n$. Contradiction. So we must have $m \\ge n$, so $m = n + ks$ for some $s \\ge 0$. But now $f(m + k) = f(n + k(s+1)) = m + k(s + 2)$. But $f(m + k) = n + k$, so $n = m + k(s + 1) > n$. Contradiction. \n\nSo if $f(m) = n$, then $m$ and $n$ have different residues $\\pmod k$. Suppose they have $r_1$ and $r_2$ respectively.

Hence if $m$ has a different residue $r \\mod k$, then $f(m)$ cannot have residue $r_1$ or $r_2$. For if $f(m)$ had residue $r_1$, then the same argument would show that all sufficiently large numbers with residue $r_1$ had $f(m) \\equiv r \\pmod k$.
