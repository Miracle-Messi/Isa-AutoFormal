The proof is done by induction, starting with the base case of n=4, where the statement is shown to be true by simplification. Then, for the inductive step, it is assumed that the statement is true for some integer m greater than or equal to 4, and it is shown that it is also true for the next integer (Suc m). The factorial of (Suc m) is expressed as (Suc m) times the factorial of m, which is shown to be greater than or equal to (Suc m) times m^2. This is then simplified and shown to be greater than or equal to m^2 + 4*m, which is equal to (m+2)^2. Finally, it is shown that (m+2)^2 is less than or equal to (Suc m)^2, completing the inductive step and proving the theorem.",
