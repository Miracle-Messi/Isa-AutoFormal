Therefore, if the surface area of a cube increases by a factor of $2$, its side length must increase by a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$, meaning the new side length of the cube is $1 * \\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{2}$. So, its volume is $({\\sqrt{2}})^3 = 2\\sqrt{2} \\Rightarrow\\mathrm{(C)}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes surface_area1 surface_area2 volume1 volume2 edge_length1 edge_length2 :: real\nassumes h0 : \"surface_area1 = 6 * (edge_length1 powr 2)\"\nand h1 : \"volume1 = edge_length1 powr 3\"\nand h2 : \"surface_area2 = 6 * (edge_length2 powr 2)\"\nand h3 : \"volume2 = edge_length2 powr 3\"\nand h4 : \"surface_area2 = 2 * surface_area1\"\nand h5 : \"volume1 = 1\"\nshows  \"volume2 = 2 * sqrt(2)\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "Two cubes have volumes $V_1$ and $V_2$, and surface areas $A_1$ and $A_2$. The surface area of the second cube is twice the surface area of the first cube. Given that the volume of the first cube is 1, find the volume of the second cube. The final answer is $2\\sqrt{2}$.",
