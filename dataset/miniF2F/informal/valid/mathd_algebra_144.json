(In particular, $d$ can't be 0, because the triangle is not equilateral.)  Then the perimeter of the triangle is $a + b + c = (b - d) + b + (b + d) = 3b = 60$, so $b = 20$.  Hence, the sides of the triangle are $20 - d$, 20, and $20 + d$.\n\nThese sides must satisfy the triangle inequality, which gives us \\[(20 - d) + 20 > 20 + d.\\] Solving for $d$, we find $2d < 20$, or $d < 10$.  Therefore, the possible values of $d$ are 1, 2, $\\dots$, 9, which gives us $9$ possible triangles.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes a b c :: nat\nassumes h0 : \"a + b + c = 60\"\nand h1 : \"a \\<le> b\"\nand h2 : \"b \\<le> c\"\nand h3 : \"b - a = c - b\"\nand h4 : \"a \\<noteq> b\"\nand h5 : \"b \\<noteq> c\"\nshows  \"card {(a, b, c) | a b c. a + b + c = 60 \\<and> a \\<le> b \\<and> b \\<le> c \\<and> b - a = c - b \\<and> a \\<noteq> b \\<and> b \\<noteq> c} = 9\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
