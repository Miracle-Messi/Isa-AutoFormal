The area of this rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length and width together. Now, let's create a new rectangle by decreasing the length by 60 units and increasing the width by 60 units. The area of this new rectangle is calculated by multiplying the new length and new width together. The problem asks to find the difference between the area of the new rectangle and the area of the original rectangle. The answer is 3600 square units."
