        "informal problem": "Given a sequence of real numbers [6, a, b], where a and b are unknown, and it is known that a is the common ratio of a geometric sequence starting with 6. The sequence [1 / b, a, 54] is also given, which is another geometric sequence with the same common ratio. Find the value of a, given that it is equal to $3\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe sequence defined by a common ratio r is given by $a = r \\cdot 6$. Since $a$ is the common ratio of both sequences, it follows that $b = a \\cdot r$. By setting the ratio of the second sequence equal to 1, we have $\\frac{1}{b} = \\frac{1}{a} \\cdot r'$, which implies $r = r \\cdot r'$ or $r' = 1$.\n\nSubstituting $r = 1$ in the first equation, we have $a = 6$. Since $a$ is the common ratio of a geometric sequence, $a = a^2 \\cdot r^2$, which implies $a^2 = \\frac{6}{r^2}$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $a = \\sqrt{\\frac{6}{r^2}}$. Since $a = 3\\sqrt{2}$, we have $\\sqrt{\\frac{6}{r^2}} = 3\\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, $r = \\frac{2}{3}$ and $a = 3\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThus, the value of $a$ is $3\\sqrt{2}$."
