        "informal problem": "Consider the sum of the first 101 positive integers, $1+1+2+\\cdots+1+1+101$. Prove that the remainder when this sum is divided by 6 is equal to 4.\n\nProof by induction:\n\nBase case: The sum of the first two terms is 1 + 1 = 2. Since 2 is even, its remainder when divided by 6 is 0, but since we want the remainder to be 4, we need to add 4 to this base case. Thus, the base case is 2 + 4 = 6, which leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 6.\n\nInductive step: Assume the sum of the first n terms leaves a remainder of p when divided by 6. We will prove that the sum of the first n+1 terms leaves a remainder of (p+2) mod 6.\n\nBy the modulo addition property, the remainder of the sum of two numbers x and y is the same as the remainder of x+y when divided by a modulo b if the remainders of x and y when divided by a modulo b are the same.\n\nTherefore, since the remainders of the first n terms and the first n+1 terms differ only by the last term, the remainder of the sum of the first n+1 terms will be (p+2) mod 6, as required.\n\nSince the base case holds, and the inductive step holds for all n<101, it follows that the sum of the first 101 positive integers leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 6."
