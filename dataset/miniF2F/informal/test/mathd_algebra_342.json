What is the first term of the series? Show that it is \\frac{42}{5}.\n ### Proof\n Let the first term be $a$ and the common difference be $d$.  The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms.  The fifth term is $a + 4d$, so the sum of the first five terms is \\[\\frac{a + (a + 4d)}{2} \\cdot 5 = 5a + 10d = 70,\\]which implies that $a + 2d = 14$, so $2d = 14 - a$.\n\nThe tenth term is $a + 9d$, so the sum of the first ten terms is \\[\\frac{a + (a + 9d)}{2} \\cdot 10 = 10a + 45d = 210,\\]which implies that $2a + 9d = 42$, so $9d = 42 - 2a$.\n\nFrom the equation $2d = 14 - a$, $18d = 126 - 9a$, and from the equation $9d = 42 - 2a$, $18d = 84 - 4a$, so \\[126 - 9a = 84 - 4a.\\]Then $5a = 42$, so $a = \\frac{42}{5}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes a n :: real and arith_series :: \"real \\<Rightarrow> real \\<Rightarrow> real\"\nassumes h0 : \"\\<forall> a n. arith_series a n = n * (2 * a + (n - 1))\"\nand h1 : \"arith_series a 5 = 70\"\nand h2 : \"arith_series a 10 = 210\"\nshows  \"a = 42 / 5\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
