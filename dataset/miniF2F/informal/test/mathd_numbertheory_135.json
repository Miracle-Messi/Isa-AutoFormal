Thus $B$ is even and not divisible by $3$. Also, $A$ is odd, so $\\overline{AB} = 10A + B$, where $4$ does not divide into $10A$. Thus, $4$ cannot divide into $B$ either, otherwise $10A + B$ would not be divisible by $4$. Then, $B$ must be equal to $2$.\n\nUsing the divisibility criterion for $9$, it follows that $3(A+B+C)$ is divisible by $9$, that is $3$ divides into $A+C+2$. Thus, $A+C = 4,7,10,13,16 \\quad (*)$.
