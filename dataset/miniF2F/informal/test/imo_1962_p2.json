Solving these we get that the left hand side is defined for $x\\in \\left[ -1,1 \\right]$.\n\nNow obviously the function $f(x)=\\sqrt{\\sqrt{3-x}-\\sqrt{x+1}}$ is continuous on $\\left[ -1,1 \\right]$, with $f(-1)=\\sqrt 2$ and $f(1)=0$.\nMoreover, as $3-x$ is a decreasing and $x+1$ an increasing function, both $\\sqrt{3-x}$ and $-\\sqrt{x+1}$ are decreasing functions, and hence $f(x)$ is a decreasing function. Therefore there is exactly one solution to $f(x)=\\dfrac{1}{2}$.\n\nWe can now find this solution:\n\n$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{\\sqrt{3-x}-\\sqrt{x+1}} &= \\dfrac{1}{2}\n\\\\\n\\sqrt{3-x}-\\sqrt{x+1} &= \\dfrac{1}{4}\n\\\\\n\\sqrt{3-x} &= \\dfrac{1}{4} + \\sqrt{x+1}\n\\\\\n3-x &= \\dfrac 1{16} + x+1 + \\dfrac{\\sqrt{x+1}}2\n\\\\\n2 - 2x - \\dfrac 1{16} &= \\dfrac{\\sqrt{x+1}}2\n\\\\\n31 - 32x &= 8\\sqrt{x+1}\n\\\\\n1024 x^2 - 1984x + 961 &= 64(x+1)\n\\\\\n1024 x^2 - 2048x + 897 &= 0\n\\end{align*}\n$\n\n(Note the little trick in the third row: placing the square roots on opposite sides of the equation. Squaring the equation in the second row would work as well, but this way is a little more pleasant, as the one remaining square root after the squaring will essentially be one of the original two, not their product.)\n\nSolving the quadratic equation for $x$, we get\n$\nx_{1,2}=\\dfrac{ 2^{11} \\pm \\sqrt{ 2^{22} - 2^{12}\\cdot 897} }{2^{11}} = 1 \\pm \\dfrac{\\sqrt{127}}{32}\n$\n\nThe reason why we got two roots is that while solving the original equation we squared both sides twice, and this could have created additional solutions.
