Therefore, the answer is $\\textbf{(C)} ~76$.\n *)\n\n theorem\nfixes morning_mean afternoon_mean :: real\nand morning_students afternoon_students :: real\nand total_students total_mean :: real\nassumes h0 : \"morning_mean = 84\"\nand h1 : \"afternoon_mean = 70\"\nand h2 : \"morning_students / afternoon_students = 3 / 4\"\nand h3 : \"total_students = morning_students + afternoon_students\"\nand h4 : \"total_mean = (morning_mean * morning_students + afternoon_mean * afternoon_students) / total_students\"\nshows  \"total_mean = 76\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": " In a school, there are two groups of students: one in the morning and one in the afternoon. The average score of the morning group is 84, and the average score of the afternoon group is 70. The ratio of the number of morning students to the number of afternoon students is 3:4. The total number of students is the sum of the morning students and the afternoon students. The overall average score of all students is calculated by taking the weighted average of the morning and afternoon group averages, where the weights are the respective numbers of students. What is the overall average score of all students? The answer is 76.",
