        "informal problem": " The problem states that there is no integer solution for the equation $4x^3 - 7y^3 = 2003$, where $x$ and $y$ are integers. The proof is done by induction on $x$, considering two cases: the base case (when $x$ is the smallest integer) and the step case (when $x$ is an arbitrary integer). In both cases, it is shown that no integer $y$ can satisfy the equation, leading to the conclusion that there is no integer solution for the given equation.",
