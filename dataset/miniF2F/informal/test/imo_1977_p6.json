By the given inequality we have that $f(a_n)>f(a_{n+1})$, this can be used to form a inequality chain of decreasing positive integers: $ f(a_0)>f(a_1)>f(a_2)>...$\nBy [[Infinite Descent]], this sequence must terminate, and the only way it can terminate is if we input something into $f$ that is outside of its range. This can only happen if $a_n=1$ since the range and domain of $f$ are the positive integers. Since $a_0\\neq 1$, there is a integer $t$ ($a_{n-1}-1$) such that $f(t)=1$.\n\nNow if $t\\neq 1$, then $f(t)=1>f(f(t-1))$, which is impossible since $f(f(t-1))\\ge 1$ by the range of $f$, so we have $t=1$ is the only time when $f(t)=1$.\n\nNow for the inductive step.\n\nAssume that $f(n)=n$ for all $n<k$ and these are the only times these values occur. We will prove that $f(k)=k$ and that this is the only time this value occurs. Define the sequence $a_n$ similarly, except that $a_0>k$, by the reasoning above, there is a $a_m$ such that $f(a_m)=1$, by the inductive assumption, this means that $a_m=f(a_{m-1}-1)=1$, we can repeat the inductive assumption to get that $a_{m-k+1}=k$. This implies that $f(a_{m-k}-1)=k$. Thus, there is a $t$ such that $f(t)=k$.\n\nNow for that $t$, we have $k>f(f(t-1))$, which means that $k+1>t$ by the inductive assumption which implies $t=k$ since we must have $t>k-1$, otherwise $f(t)<k$.

        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n Let $f(n)$ be a function $f: \\mathbb{N}^{+}\\to\\mathbb{N}^{+}$. Prove that if $ f(n+1) > f(f(n)) $ for each positive integer $n$, then $f(n)=n$.\n ### Proof\n We will prove this via induction. First we will prove there is a $t$ such that $f(t)=1$ and then that $t=1$ is the only such solution.\n\nDefine the sequence $a_n$ with $a_0>1$ for $a_0\\in \\mathbb{N} $ and $a_k=f(a_{k-1}-1)$. By the given inequality we have that $f(a_n)>f(a_{n+1})$, this can be used to form a inequality chain of decreasing positive integers: $ f(a_0)>f(a_1)>f(a_2)>...$\nBy [[Infinite Descent]], this sequence must terminate, and the only way it can terminate is if we input something into $f$ that is outside of its range. This can only happen if $a_n=1$ since the range and domain of $f$ are the positive integers. Since $a_0\\neq 1$, there is a integer $t$ ($a_{n-1}-1$) such that $f(t)=1$.\n\nNow if $t\\neq 1$, then $f(t)=1>f(f(t-1))$, which is impossible since $f(f(t-1))\\ge 1$ by the range of $f$, so we have $t=1$ is the only time when $f(t)=1$.\n\nNow for the inductive step.\n\nAssume that $f(n)=n$ for all $n<k$ and these are the only times these values occur. We will prove that $f(k)=k$ and that this is the only time this value occurs. Define the sequence $a_n$ similarly, except that $a_0>k$, by the reasoning above, there is a $a_m$ such that $f(a_m)=1$, by the inductive assumption, this means that $a_m=f(a_{m-1}-1)=1$, we can repeat the inductive assumption to get that $a_{m-k+1}=k$. This implies that $f(a_{m-k}-1)=k$. Thus, there is a $t$ such that $f(t)=k$.\n\nNow for that $t$, we have $k>f(f(t-1))$, which means that $k+1>t$ by the inductive assumption which implies $t=k$ since we must have $t>k-1$, otherwise $f(t)<k$. So $t=k$ is the only time when $f(t)=k$\n\nSo the inductive step is complete. Therefore, by induction $f(n)=n$ for all positive integers $n$.\n *)\n\n theorem\nfixes f :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> nat\"\nassumes h0 : \"\\<forall> n. n > 0 \\<longrightarrow> f (n + 1) > f (f n)\"\nshows  \"f n = n\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": " The Isabelle version states the following:\n\nGiven a function f that maps natural numbers to natural numbers, there is an assumption (h0) that for all natural numbers n greater than 0, the function value at the point (n + 1) is greater than the function value at the point (f(n)). From this, it is concluded that the function value at any natural number n is equal to n itself.\n\nIn simpler terms, this means:\n\nConsider a function f that takes a natural number as input and gives another natural number as output. It is known that for any natural number n greater than zero, the output of the function when the input is (n + 1) is always larger than the output of the function when the input is the result of applying the function to n. Based on this information, it is concluded that for any natural number n, the output of the function f when the input is n is always equal to n.",
