        "informal problem": "There exists an integer $n$ greater than $10$ that can be expressed as both a perfect square and a perfect cube. The theorem below uses mathematical induction to prove that such an integer is equal to $64$.\n\nProof:\n\nFirst, we consider the base case $n = 11$. If $11$ is both a perfect square and a perfect cube, then there exist integers $m$ and $k$ such that $m^2 = 11$ and $k^3 = 11$. We can find these values by taking the square root and cube root of $11$, respectively. Since the square root and cube root of $11$ are equal, we have $m = k$. By the definition of a perfect square and perfect cube, we have $m^2 = n^2$ and $k^3 = n^3$. Therefore, $m^2 = k^3$, which implies that $m = k$ is both a perfect square and a perfect cube. However, we will arrive at a contradiction, as we will show below.\n\nWe have $m^2 = n^2$ and $m = k$. It follows that $n^2 = k^3$. Since $11$ is neither a perfect square nor a perfect cube, we can assume that $n$ is odd, and hence $n^2 = (2p+1)^2 = 4p^2+4p+1$. We can write $k = m = p^2$. Then, $n^2 = 4p^2+4p+1 = (2p+1)^2 = k^3$. This implies that $(2p+1)^2 = k^3$. Since $k$ is a perfect cube, it follows that $k$ is odd, and therefore $k = 2q+1$. We can write $k^3 = (2q+1)^3 = 8q^3+6q^2+6q+1$. Comparing the constant terms, we have $1 = 6q+1$. Since $q$ is an integer, this implies that $q = -5$, but this is a contradiction.\n\nNow, we proceed with the induction step. We assume that for any integer $m$ less than $n$, there is no integer that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube. We need to show that $n$ is also not both a perfect square and a perfect cube. By the induction hypothesis, there is no integer $p$ such that $p^2 = n$ or $p^3 = n$. Since $n > 10$, it cannot be a perfect square, as the smallest perfect square greater than $10$ is $16$. We will show that $n$ is not a perfect cube either.\n\nSuppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $n$ is a perfect cube. Then, there exists an integer $p$ such that $p^3 = n$. Since $n > 10$, the smallest cube greater than $10$ is $125 = 5^3$. Since $n$ is not a perfect square, we cannot have $n = p^2$ for any integer $p$. Therefore, $n$ must be a prime number. However, no prime number can be a perfect cube, as every prime number greater than $2$ can be expressed as $p = 2^e \\cdot q$, where $q$ is an odd prime. Since $n$ is a prime, it follows that $n = p = 2^e \\cdot q$. Since $n"
