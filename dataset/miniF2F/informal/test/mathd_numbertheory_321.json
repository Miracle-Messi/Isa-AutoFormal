The final Answer is $1058$\n ### Proof\n Taking the given equation modulo 1399 gives \\[35\\cdot40\\equiv1\\pmod{1399},\\]so we know that 35 is the multiplicative inverse to 40.  We want to use this to find the multiplicative inverse to $4\\cdot40=160$, so we want to try to \"divide\" 35 by 4.\n\nThe difficulty in dividing by 4 is that 35 is odd.  We do know, though, that  \\[35\\equiv35+1399\\equiv1434\\pmod{1399}\\]and this number is even!  Let's go even further, though, to find a multiple of 4: \\[35\\equiv35+3\\cdot1399\\equiv4232\\pmod{1399}.\\]Factoring 4 we get  \\[35\\equiv4\\cdot1058\\pmod{1399}.\\]Finally we multiply by 40: \\[1\\equiv 40\\cdot35\\equiv40\\cdot4\\cdot1058\\equiv160\\cdot1058\\pmod{1399}.\\]This argument is inelegant.  Let's write it in a more clear order: \\begin{align*}\n1058\\cdot160&\\equiv1058\\cdot(4\\cdot40)\\\\\n&\\equiv(1058\\cdot4)\\cdot40\\\\\n&\\equiv35\\cdot40\\\\\n&\\equiv1\\pmod{1399}.\n\\end{align*}The multiplicative inverse to 160 modulo 1399 is $1058$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes n :: int\nassumes h0 : \"0 \\<le> n\"\nand h1 : \"n < 1399\"\nand h2 : \"(160 * n) mod 1399 = 1\"\nshows  \"n = 1058\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
