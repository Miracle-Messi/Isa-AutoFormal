We will show that the sum of the cubes of the numbers from 0 to $n$ is equal to the square of the sum of the squares of the numbers from 0 to $n$.\n\nBy the definition of the sum function, the sum of the cubes of the numbers from 0 to $n$ is the sum of the cubes of the numbers from 0 to $n-1$ plus the cube of $n$. Similarly, the square of the sum of the squares of the numbers from 0 to $n$ is the square of the sum of the squares of the numbers from 0 to $n-1$ plus the square of $n^2$.\n\nUsing the distributive property of multiplication over addition and the definition of the square of a number, we can simplify the right side of the equation.\n\nNow, we substitute the induction hypothesis and the simplified right side of the equation into an equality and simplify to prove that the sum of the cubes of the numbers from 0 to $n$ is equal to the square of the sum of the squares of the numbers from 0 to $n$."
