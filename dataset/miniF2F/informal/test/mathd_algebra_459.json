If Bertram, Carli, and David add their times together, the resulting sum is three times the length of time that Anna can hold her breath. Similarly, if Anna, Carli, and David sum their times, the result is four times Bertram's time period, and if Anna, Bertram, and David sum their times, the result is twice Carli's time.

The final Answer is $28$\n ### Proof\n Let $a$ denote the length of time, in minutes, that Anna holds her breath, $b$ denote the time that Bertram holds his breath, $c$ denote the time that Carli holds her breath, and $d$ denote the time that David holds his breath. Using the information in the problem, we can form the following system of linear equations (note that $\\frac{2}{5}$ of an hour is the same as $24$ minutes):  \\begin{align*}\n3a &= b + c + d \\\\\n4b &= a + c + d \\\\\n2c &= a + b + d \\\\\n8a + 10b + 6c &= 24\n\\end{align*} Subtracting the third equation from the first gives $3a - 2c = c - a$, which simplifies to $4a = 3c$. Subtracting the third equation from the second gives $4b - 2c = c - b$, so $5b = 3c$. We thus have that $4a = 5b = 3c$. Call this value $x$. Substituting $x$ for $4a$, $5b$, and $3c$ in the fourth equation gives $6x = 24$, so $x = 4$. Therefore, $a = \\frac{4}{4} = 1$, $b = \\frac{4}{5}$, and $c = \\frac{4}{3}$. Substituting these values into the first equation yields $3 = \\frac{4}{5} + \\frac{4}{3} + d$, so $d = \\frac{13}{15}$.

Subtracting the third equation from the second gives $4b - 2c = c - b$, so $5b = 3c$. We thus have that $4a = 5b = 3c$. Call this value $x$. Substituting $x$ for $4a$, $5b$, and $3c$ in the fourth equation gives $6x = 24$, so $x = 4$. Therefore, $a = \\frac{4}{4} = 1$, $b = \\frac{4}{5}$, and $c = \\frac{4}{3}$. Substituting these values into the first equation yields $3 = \\frac{4}{5} + \\frac{4}{3} + d$, so $d = \\frac{13}{15}$.
