        "informal problem": " The Isabelle version of the problem is stating a theorem about prime numbers and their powers. The theorem is called \"prime_power_prime\" and it is formulated for natural numbers (n :: nat). The theorem assumes that n is greater than 0 (h0 : \"n > 0\") and that the number (2^n - 1) is a prime number (h1 : \"prime (2^n - 1)\"). The theorem then concludes that n itself is a prime number.\n\nThe proof of this theorem is done by induction on n, using the \"less_induct\" rule. The proof first checks if n is equal to 1. If it is, then n is a prime number by definition. If n is not equal to 1, then it must be greater than 1. In this case, the proof expresses n as the successor of the successor of some number m (n = Suc (Suc m)). The proof then uses the assumption that (2^(Suc (Suc m)) - 1) is a prime number to show that (2 * 2^m - 1) is a prime number. This is further simplified to (2 * (2^m - 1) + 1), which is also a prime number. The proof then uses the \"prime_factors_power_2\" rule to show that (2^m - 1) is a prime number. By the induction hypothesis, this implies that m is a prime number. Since n is the successor of the successor of m, n is also a prime number.\n\nIn simpler terms, the theorem is saying that if a certain number (2^n - 1) is a prime number, then the number n is also a prime number. The proof of this theorem is done by breaking down the number n into smaller parts and using the properties of prime numbers to show that n is indeed a prime number."

The proof is done through induction on \"n\" using the less_induct rule. The proof considers two cases: when \"n\" equals 1, and when \"n\" is not equal to 1. In the latter case, it is shown that \"n\" must be greater than 1, and then it is proven that \"2^m\" is a prime number, where \"m\" is the number obtained by subtracting 1 from \"n\".

If it is, then n is a prime number by definition. If n is not equal to 1, then it must be greater than 1. In this case, the proof expresses n as the successor of the successor of some number m (n = Suc (Suc m)). The proof then uses the assumption that (2^(Suc (Suc m)) - 1) is a prime number to show that (2 * 2^m - 1) is a prime number. This is further simplified to (2 * (2^m - 1) + 1), which is also a prime number. The proof then uses the \"prime_factors_power_2\" rule to show that (2^m - 1) is a prime number. By the induction hypothesis, this implies that m is a prime number. Since n is the successor of the successor of m, n is also a prime number.\n\nIn simpler terms, the theorem is saying that if a certain number (2^n - 1) is a prime number, then the number n is also a prime number. The proof of this theorem is done by breaking down the number n into smaller parts and using the properties of prime numbers to show that n is indeed a prime number.",
