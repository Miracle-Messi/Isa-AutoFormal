This means we only need to consider the modulo 10 residues of the numbers of marbles each of them brought:  \\begin{align*} 239 &\\equiv 9 \\pmod{10} \\\\\n174 &\\equiv 4 \\pmod{10} \\\\\n83 &\\equiv 3 \\pmod{10}\n\\end{align*}  Our goal is to find the modulo 10 residue of the total number of marbles.  We find this by adding the residues above: $9 + 4 + 3 = 16 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{10}$.  Since we were working in modulo 10, this is the same as a units digit calculation.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes sally_marbles wei_hwa_marbles zoe_marbles total_marbles marbles_to_remove :: nat\nassumes h0 : \"sally_marbles = 239\"\nand h1 : \"wei_hwa_marbles = 174\"\nand h2 : \"zoe_marbles = 83\"\nand h3 : \"total_marbles = sally_marbles + wei_hwa_marbles + zoe_marbles\"\nand h4 : \"marbles_to_remove = total_marbles mod 10\"\nshows  \"marbles_to_remove = 6\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
