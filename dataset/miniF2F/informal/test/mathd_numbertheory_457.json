The base case is when $n=17$, in which case it is proven that $80325$ is a factor of $17!$ (which is $1$ by definition).\n\nThe inductive step assumes that $80325$ is a factor of $(n-1)!$ and then proves that it is a factor of $n!$. This is done using the multiplication property of factorials and the induction hypothesis.\n\nThe theorem is important because it states that $80325$ is a factor of any factorial starting from the factorial of $17$. This can be useful for various mathematical or computational applications.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that this theorem is not true for smaller values of $n$. For example, $80325$ is not a factor of $16!$ (as can be proven using a counterexample, such as $n=16$ in the theorem's negation)."

The final Answer is $17$\n ### Proof\n We find the prime factorization of $80325$, which is $3^3 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 17$. The largest prime in the factorization is $17$, so $n$ is at least 17. Since there are three factors of $3$, two factors of $5$, and one factor of $7$ in the prime factorization of $17!$, the minimum value of $n$ is $17$.\n *)\n\n theorem\nfixes n :: nat\nassumes h0 : \"n > 0\"\nand h1 : \"80325 dvd fact n\"\nshows  \"n = 17\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
