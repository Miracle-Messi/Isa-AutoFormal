(Disjoint sets are defined as sets that have no common elements.) Find the remainder obtained when $n$ is divided by $1000$.\n The final Answer is 501\n ### Proof\n Let the two disjoint subsets be $A$ and $B$, and let $C = S-(A+B)$. For each $i \\in S$, either $i \\in A$, $i \\in B$, or $i \\in C$.\n So there are $3^{10}$ ways to organize the elements of $S$ into disjoint $A$, $B$, and $C$.\n However, there are $2^{10}$ ways to organize the elements of $S$ such that $A = \\emptyset$ and $S = B+C$, and there are $2^{10}$ ways to organize the elements of $S$ such that $B = \\emptyset$ and $S = A+C$.\n But, the combination such that $A = B = \\emptyset$ and $S = C$ is counted twice.\n Thus, there are $3^{10}-2\\cdot2^{10}+1$ ordered pairs of sets $(A,B)$. But since the question asks for the number of unordered sets $\\{ A,B \\}$, $n = \\frac{1}{2}(3^{10}-2\\cdot2^{10}+1) = 28501 \\equiv \\boxed{501} \\pmod{1000}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes S :: \"int set\" and n :: int\nassumes h0 : \"S = {x. 1 \\<le> x \\<and> x \\<le> 10}\"\nand h1 : \"n = card {A. \\<exists> A1 A2.
