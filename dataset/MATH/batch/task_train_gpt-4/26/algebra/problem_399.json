The final Answer is 4\n ### Proof\n We know that $$\\left(x+\\frac{1}{x}\\right)^3=x^3+3(x^2)\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)+3(x)\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)^3=x^3+\\frac{1}{x^3}+3\\left(x+\\frac{1}{x}\\right).$$Let $x+\\frac{1}{x}=a$.\n Then our equation is $a^3=x^3+\\frac{1}{x^3}+3a$.\n We know $x^3+\\frac{1}{x^3}=52$, so we have $a^3=52+3a$ or $a^3-3a-52=0$.\n By the rational root theorem, the possible roots of this polynomial equation are the divisors of 52 as well as their negatives: $\\pm1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 13, \\pm 26, \\pm 52$.
