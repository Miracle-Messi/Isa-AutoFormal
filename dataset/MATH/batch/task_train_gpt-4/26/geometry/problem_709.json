[asy] pair A = (-1,0); pair B = (0,0); pair C = (0,1); path q = B--A..dir(135)..C--cycle; draw( (-1.5, 0)--(1.5, 0), linewidth(2) );\n filldraw( q, gray, linewidth(2) ); draw(rotate(-90)*q, dashed); label(\"$A$\", A, S); label(\"$B$\", B, S); label(\"$C$\", C, N); [/asy] In this phase, point $B$ does not move. Phase 2: The quarter circle pivots $90^\\circ$ about point $C$.\n [asy] pair A = (0,1); pair B = (0,0); pair C = (1,0); path q = B--A..dir(45)..C--cycle; draw( (-0.5, 0)--(2.5, 0), linewidth(2) ); filldraw( q, gray, linewidth(2) ); draw(rotate(-90, (1,0))*q, dashed);\n label(\"$A$\", A, N); label(\"$B$\", B, S); label(\"$C$\", C, S); [/asy] In this phase, point $B$ is always $\\frac{2}{\\pi}$ cm away from point $C$, so its path is a quarter-circle with radius $\\frac{2}{\\pi}$.\n The circumference of a circle with radius $\\frac{2}{\\pi}$ is $2\\pi(\\frac{2}{\\pi}) = 4$, so $B$ travels $\\frac{1}{4}(4) = 1$ cm. Phase 3: The quarter circle rolls along arc $CA$. [asy] pair A = (1,0); pair B = (0,0); pair C = (0,-1);\n path q = B--A..dir(-45)..C--cycle; draw( (-0.5, -1)--(2.07, -1), linewidth(2) ); filldraw( q, gray, linewidth(2) ); draw(shift((1.57,0))*rotate(-90)*q, dashed); label(\"$A$\", A, N); label(\"$B$\", B, N); label(\"$C$\", C, S);\n [/asy] In this phase, $B$ is always $\\frac{2}{\\pi}$ away from the ground, so its path is a straight line segment parallel to the ground.\n From the diagram, we see the length of this line segment is equal to the distance between the original position of $C$ and the new position of $A$. This distance is traced out by arc $CA$ as it rolls.\n So its length is the length of arc $CA$, which is 1 cm (since it's a quarter of a circle with radius $\\frac{2}{\\pi}$, a length we've already calculated).\n So the path of $B$ has length 1 cm. Phase 4: The quarter circle pivots $90^\\circ$ about point $A$. [asy] pair A = (0,-1); pair B = (0,0); pair C = (-1,0); path q = B--A..dir(-135)..C--cycle; draw( (-1.5, -1)--(1.5, -1), linewidth(2) );\n filldraw( q, gray, linewidth(2) ); draw(rotate(-90, (0,-1))*q, dashed); label(\"$A$\", A, S); label(\"$B$\", B, N); label(\"$C$\", C, N); [/asy] As in phase 2, the path of $B$ has length 1 cm. Putting this together, the path of point $B$ has total length $1 + 1 + 1 = \\boxed{3\\text{ cm}}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes B :: real\nassumes h0 : \"BC = 2 / pi\"\nand h1 : \"Arc AC is a quarter-circle with center B\"\nand h2 : \"The shaded region ABC is rolled along a straight board PQ until it reaches its original orientation for the first time with point B landing at point B'\"\nshows  \"the length of the path that point B travels = 3\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
