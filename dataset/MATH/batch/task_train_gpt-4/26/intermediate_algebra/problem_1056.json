        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n For which integer $a$ does $x^2 - x + a$ divide $x^{13} + x + 90$? The final Answer is 2\n ### Proof\n We have that \\[(x^2 - x + a) p(x) = x^{13} + x + 90\\]for some polynomial $p(x)$ with integer coefficients. Setting $x = 0,$ we get $ap(0) = 90.$  This means $a$ divides 90. Setting $x = 1,$ we get $ap(1) = 92.$  This means $a$ divides 92.\n Since $a$ divides both 90 and 92, it must divide $92 - 90 = 2.$  Hence, $a$ must be equal to 2, 1, $-1,$ or $-2.$ Setting $x = -1,$ we get $(a + 2) p(-1) = 88.$  This means $a + 2$ divides 88. Of the four values we listed above, only $a = -1$ and $a = 2$ work.\n If $a = -1,$ then $x^2 - x + a$ becomes $x^2 - x - 1 = 0$. The roots are \\[x = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}.\\]In particular, one root is positive, and one root is negative.
