Compute the candle's height in centimeters $\\tfrac{T}{2}$ seconds after it is lit. The final Answer is 35\n ### Proof\n Since the candle is $119$ centimeters tall, the time the candle takes to burn down is \\[T = \\sum_{k=1}^{119} 10k = 10 \\cdot \\frac{119 \\cdot 120}{2} = 71400.\\]We want to compute the height of the candle at time $\\tfrac{T}{2} = 35700$ seconds.\n Suppose that, at this time, the first $m$ centimeters have burnt down completely, but not the $(m+1)$st centimeter completely. Then we must have \\[\\sum_{k=1}^m 10k \\le 35700 < \\sum_{k=1}^{m+1} 10k\\](the first quantity is the time it takes for the first $m$ centimeters to burn down; the last is the time it takes for the first $(m+1)$ centimeters to burn down).\n This simplifies to \\[5m(m+1) \\le 35700 < 5(m+1)(m+2).\\]To find $m$, we note that we should have $5m^2 \\approx 35700$, or $m^2 \\approx 7140$, so $m \\approx 85$.

        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n A large candle is $119$ centimeters tall. It is designed to burn down more quickly when it is first lit and more slowly as it approaches its bottom. Specifically, the candle takes $10$ seconds to burn down the first centimeter from the top, $20$ seconds to burn down the second centimeter, and $10k$ seconds to burn down the $k$-th centimeter. (The candle burns down each individual centimeter at a fixed rate.)\n\nSuppose it takes $T$ seconds for the candle to burn down completely.
