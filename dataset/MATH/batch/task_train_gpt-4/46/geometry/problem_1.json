The preimage has an area of 4 square units, so its side length is 2 units.\n Since the center of the preimage is at $(8, -8)$, the four vertices of the preimage are at $(7, -9), (7, -7), (9, -7)$ and $(9, -9)$. The point $(9, -9)$ is the farthest from the origin on the preimage, so the point farthest from the origin on the image of square $ABCD$ is $\\boxed{(18, -18)}.$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes origin :: complex and square_center :: complex and square_vertex :: complex\nand dilation_center :: complex and dilation_factor :: real\nassumes h0 : \"origin = Complex (Re 0) (Im 0)\"\nand h1 : \"square_center = Complex (Re 8) (Im (-8))\"\nand h2 : \"square_vertex = Complex (Re (Re square_center + sqrt 2)) (Im square_center)\"\nand h3 : \"dilation_center = Complex (Re 0) (Im 0)\"\nand h4 : \"dilation_factor = 2\"\nand h5 : \"dilation_factor * (square_vertex - dilation_center) = dilation_vertex - dilation_center\"\nshows  \"dilation_vertex = Complex (Re 18) (Im (-18))\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "A square has its center at the point (8, -8) and one of its vertices is located at the point (8 + \u221a2, -8). The square is dilated from the origin (0, 0) by a factor of 2. Find the coordinates of the vertex after the dilation. The final answer is (18, -18)."
