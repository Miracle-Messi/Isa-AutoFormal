        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n Express $0.\\overline{1}+0.\\overline{01}+0.\\overline{0001}$ as a common fraction. The final Answer is \\frac{1213}{9999}\n ### Proof\n We begin this problem by summing $0.\\overline{1}$, $0.\\overline{01}$, and $0.\\overline{0001}$ as decimals.\n We do this by realizing that $0.\\overline{1}$ can also be written as $0.\\overline{1111}$ and that $0.\\overline{01}$ can be written as $0.\\overline{0101}$.\n Thus, $0.\\overline{1}+0.\\overline{01}+0.\\overline{0001}=0.\\overline{1111}+0.\\overline{0101}+0.\\overline{0001}=0.\\overline{1213}$. (Since there is no carrying involved, we can add each decimal place with no problems.)\n To express the number $0.\\overline{1213}$ as a fraction, we call it $x$ and subtract it from $10000x$: $$\\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l} &10000x &=& 1213&.12131213\\ldots \\\\ - &x &=& 0&.12131213\\ldots \\\\ \\hline\n &9999x &=& 1213 & \\end{array}$$ This shows that $0.\\overline{1213} = \\boxed{\\frac{1213}{9999}}$. (Note: We have to check that this answer is in lowest terms. The prime factorization of $9999$ is $3^2\\cdot 11\\cdot 101$, so we must check that $1213$ is not divisible by $3$, $11$, or $101$.\n Since $1+2+1+3=7$ is not a multiple of $3$, neither is $1213$. Also, $1213 = 11^2\\cdot 10 + 3 = 101\\cdot 12 + 1$, so $1213$ can't be a multiple of $11$ or $101$.)\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes a b c :: real\nassumes h0 : \"a = 1 / 9\"\nand h1 : \"b = 1 / 99\"\nand h2 : \"c = 1 / 999\"\nshows  \"a + b + c = 1213 / 9999\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
