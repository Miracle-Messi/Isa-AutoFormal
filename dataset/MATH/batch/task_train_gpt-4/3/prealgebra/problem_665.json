        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n Of the numbers 1, 2, 3, ..., 15, which number has the greatest number of divisors (the dots mean that we are including all the integers between 1 and 15)? The final Answer is 12\n ### Proof\n To find the number of divisors an integer has, we can count the number of positive divisors and double the result. For example, the positive divisors of 4 are 1, 2, and 4 while the set of all divisors of 4 is $\\{-1,-2,-4,1,2,4\\}$.\n So the number with the most divisors will be the same as the number with the most positive divisors.\n We can find the number of divisors of an integer by finding the divisors in pairs. For example, to find the divisors of 15, we begin by listing \\[ 1, \\underline{\\hphantom{3}}, \\ldots, \\underline{\\hphantom{3}}, 15.\n \\]Fifteen is not divisible by 2, so we skip to 3 and find $3\\cdot 5 = 15$, so we fill in 3 and 5.
