Also to retain its original position, exactly $131 - 1 = 130$ numbers must be in front of it. There are $\\frac{130}{2} = 65$ cards from each of piles A, B in front of card 131.\n This suggests that $n = 131 + 65 = 196$; the total number of cards is $196 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{392}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes n :: nat and A B :: \"nat list\"\nassumes h0 : \"length A = n\"\nand h1 : \"length B = n\"\nand h2 : \"A = [1 ..< n + 1]\"\nand h3 : \"B = [n + 1 ..< 2 * n + 1]\"\nand h4 : \"interleave A B = [1 ..< 2 * n + 1]\"\nand h5 : \"\\<forall>k. k \\<le> n \\<longrightarrow> interleave A B !

        "informal problem": "Two lists A and B are created such that A contains the numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) and B contains the numbers from n + 1 to 2n (inclusive). The lists are interleaved such that every odd-indexed element of the interleaved list comes from B, and every even-indexed element comes from A.
