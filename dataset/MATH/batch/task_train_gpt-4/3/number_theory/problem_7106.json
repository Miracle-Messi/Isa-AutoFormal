Since all of Isabella's test scores can be expressed as the sum of $90$ and an integer between $1$ and $10$, we rewrite the problem into receiving scores between $1$ and $10$.\n Later, we can add $90$ to her score to obtain the real answer.\n From this point of view, the problem states that Isabella's score on the seventh test was $5$.\n We note that Isabella received $7$ integer scores out of $1$ to $10$. Since $5$ is already given as the seventh test score, the possible scores for Isabella on the other six tests are $S={1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10}$.\n The average score for the seven tests must be an integer. In other words, six distinct integers must be picked from set $S$ above, and their sum with $5$ must be a multiple of $7$. The interval containing the possible sums of the six numbers in S are from $1 +2+3+4+6+7=23$ to $4+6+7+8+9+10=44$.\n We must now find multiples of $7$ from the interval $23+5 = 28$ to $44+5=49$. There are four possibilities: $28$, $35$, $42$, $49$.\n However, we also note that the sum of the six numbers (besides $5$) must be a multiple of $6$ as well.\n Thus, $35$ is the only valid choice. (The six numbers sum to $30$.)\n Thus the sum of the six numbers equals to $30$.\n We apply the logic above in a similar way for the sum of the scores from the first test to the fifth test. The sum must be a multiple of $5$. The possible interval is from $1+2+3+4+6=16$ to $6+7+8+9+10=40$.\n Since the sum of the five scores must be less than $30$, the only possibilities are $20$ and $25$.\n However, we notice that $25$ does not work because the seventh score turns out to be $5$ from the calculation.\n Therefore, the sum of Isabella's scores from test $1$ to $5$ is $20$.\n Therefore, her score on the sixth test is $10$. Our final answer is $10+90=  \\boxed{100}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes scores :: \"nat list\"\nassumes h0 : \"length scores = 7\"\nand h1 : \"\\<forall> score \\<in> set scores. 91 \\<le> score \\<and> score \\<le> 100\"\nand h2 : \"\\<forall> i \\<in> {1..7}. is_int (average (take i scores))\"\nand h3 : \"scores ! 6 = 95\"\nshows  \"scores ! 5 = 100\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
