        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n The infinite sequence $S=\\{s_1,s_2,s_3,\\ldots\\}$ is defined by $s_1=7$ and $s_n=7^{s_{n-1}}$ for each integer $n>1$. What is the remainder when $s_{100}$ is divided by $5$? The final Answer is 3\n ### Proof\n Another way of writing the sequence $S$ is $\\{7,7^7,7^{7^7},7^{7^{7^7}},\\ldots\\}$.\n We wish to determine the $100^{\\text{th}}$ term of this sequence modulo $5$. Note that $s_{100} = 7^{s_{99}}\\equiv 2^{s_{99}}\\pmod 5$. In order to determine the remainder of $2^{s_{99}}$ when divided by $5$, we look for a pattern in the powers of $2$ modulo $5$.\n Computing a few powers of $2$ yields \\[\\{2^0,2^1,2^2,2^3,2^4,\\ldots\\}\\equiv \\{1,2,4,3,1,\\ldots\\}\\pmod 5.\\]So we have a cyclic pattern $1,2,4,3$ of length $4$ (this is called a period).\n Now we need to determine where $2^{s_{99}}$ falls in the cycle; to do that, we must determine the residue of $s_{99}\\pmod 4$, since the cycle has length $4$. Note that \\begin{align} 7&\\equiv -1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4,\\\\\n 7^7&\\equiv (-1)^7 \\equiv -1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4,\\\\ 7^{7^7}&\\equiv (-1)^{7^7}\\equiv -1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4,\\\\ &\\vdots \\end{align}Continuing in this manner, we always have $s_n \\equiv 3\\pmod 4$.\n Thus, $s_{100} = 2^{s_{99}} \\equiv 2^3 \\equiv \\boxed{3}\\pmod 5$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes s :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> nat\"\nassumes h0 : \"s 1 = 7\"\nand h1 : \"\\<forall>n. n > 1 \\<longrightarrow> s n = 7 powr s (n-1)\"\nshows  \"s 100 mod 5 = 3\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "A sequence $s$ is defined such that the first term $s(1)$ is 7, and for all natural numbers $n > 1$, the $n$th term is equal to 7 raised to the power of the $(n-1)$th term.
