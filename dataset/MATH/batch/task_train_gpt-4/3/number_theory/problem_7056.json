(Otherwise, we can group divisors into pairs whose product is $n$.)\n Thus, $S(n)$ is odd if and only if there are an odd number of perfect squares less than $n$.\n So $S(1), S(2)$ and $S(3)$ are odd, while $S(4), S(5), \\ldots, S(8)$ are even, and $S(9), \\ldots, S(15)$ are odd, and so on.\n So, for a given $n$, if we choose the positive integer $m$ such that $m^2 \\leq n < (m + 1)^2$ we see that $S(n)$ has the same parity as $m$. It follows that the numbers between $1^2$ and $2^2$, between $3^2$ and $4^2$, and so on, all the way up to the numbers between $43^2$ and $44^2 = 1936$ have $S(n)$ odd.\n These are the only such numbers less than $2005$ (because $45^2 = 2025 > 2005$). Notice that the difference between consecutive squares are consecutively increasing odd numbers.\n Thus, there are $3$ numbers between $1$ (inclusive) and $4$ (exclusive), $5$ numbers between $4$ and $9$, and so on. The number of numbers from $n^2$ to $(n + 1)^2$ is $(n + 1 - n)(n + 1 + n) = 2n + 1$.\n Whenever the lowest square beneath a number is odd, the parity will be odd, and the same for even.\n Thus, $a = [2(1) + 1] + [2(3) + 1] \\ldots [2(43) + 1] = 3 + 7 + 11 \\ldots 87$. $b = [2(2) + 1] + [2(4) + 1] \\ldots [2(42) + 1] + 70 = 5 + 9 \\ldots 85 + 70$, the $70$ accounting for the difference between $2005$ and $44^2 = 1936$, inclusive.\n Notice that if we align the two and subtract, we get that each difference is equal to $2$.\n Thus, the solution is $|a - b| = |b - a| = |2 \\cdot 21 + 70 - 87| = \\boxed{25}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes n a b S :: \"int \\<Rightarrow> int\" and \u03c4 :: \"int \\<Rightarrow> int\"\nassumes h0 : \"\u03c4 1 = 1\"\nand h1 : \"\u03c4 6 = 4\"\nand h2 : \"S n = (\\<Sum>i=1..n. \u03c4 i)\"\nand h3 : \"a = card {n. n \\<in> {1..2005} \\<and> odd (S n)}\"\nand h4 : \"b = card {n. n \\<in> {1..2005} \\<and> even (S n)}\"\nshows  \"abs (a - b) = 25\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
