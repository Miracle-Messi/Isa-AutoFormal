The area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of $\\triangle POS$ and $\\triangle ROQ$ plus the sum of the areas of sectors $POR$ and $SOQ$.\n Each of $\\triangle POS$ and $\\triangle ROQ$ is right-angled and has its two perpendicular sides of length 4 (the radius of the circle).\n Therefore, the area of each of these triangles is $\\frac{1}{2}(4)(4)=8$. Each of sector $POR$ and sector $SOQ$ has area $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the total area of the circle, as each has central angle $90^\\circ$ (that is, $\\angle POR = \\angle SOQ = 90^\\circ$) and $90^\\circ$ is one-quarter of the total central angle.\n Therefore, each sector has area $\\frac{1}{4}(\\pi(4^2))=\\frac{1}{4}(16\\pi)=4\\pi$.\n Thus, the total shaded area is $2(8)+2(4\\pi)=\\boxed{16+8\\pi}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes r s :: real\nassumes h0 : \"r = 4\"\nand h1 : \"s = 4\"\nand h2 : \"\\<forall> r. area_circle r = pi * (r ^ 2)\"\nand h3 : \"area_square s = s ^ 2\"\nshows  \"area_circle r + area_square s = 16 + 8 * pi\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
