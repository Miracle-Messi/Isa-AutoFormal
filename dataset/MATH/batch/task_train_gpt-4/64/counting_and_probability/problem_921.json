There are two cases to consider: None of the babies will speak and that exactly 1 will speak.\n 1) The probability that none of the babies will speak tomorrow is $\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^{5} = 243/1024$. 2) The probability that exactly 1 will speak is $\\binom{5}{1}\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^{4}\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\frac{405}{1024}$.\n The sum of these probabilities is $\\frac{243 + 405}{1024} = \\frac{648}{1024} = \\frac{81}{128}$. Since the probability that no more than 1 baby will speak is $\\frac{81}{128}$, the probability that more than 1 baby will speak is $1 - \\frac{81}{128} = \\boxed{\\frac{47}{128}}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes P :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> real\"\nassumes h0 : \"P 1 = 1/4\"\nand h1 : \"\\<forall>n. n \\<ge> 2 \\<longrightarrow> P n = P (n - 1) * (1/4)\"\nshows  \"P 5 \\<ge> 47/128\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
