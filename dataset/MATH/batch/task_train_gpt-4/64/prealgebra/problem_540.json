        "informal problem": "Given points A, B, C, and D in a two-dimensional plane, where the distance between A and B equals the distance between A and C. Points A, B, and D are on the same line, as are points A, C, and D. The distance between B and D equals the distance between D and C. Also, the distance between A and B is 25 units and the distance between B and C is 14 units. What is the area of triangle ABC? The final answer is 168 square units."
