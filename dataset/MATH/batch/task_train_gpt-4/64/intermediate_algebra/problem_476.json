The final Answer is 262\n ### Proof\n Let $d$ be the common difference, and let $r$ be the common ratio, so $d$ and $r$ are positive integers. Then $a_n = 1 + (n - 1) d$ and $b_n = r^{n - 1},$ so \\begin{align} 1 + (k - 2) d + r^{k - 2} &= 100, \\\\\n 1 + kd + r^k &= 1000. \\end{align}Then \\begin{align} (k - 2) d + r^{k - 2} &= 99, \\\\ kd + r^k &= 999. \\end{align}From the second equation, $r^k < 999.$  If $k \\ge 4,$ then $r < 999^{1/4},$ so $r \\le 5.$\n Since the geometric sequence is increasing, $r \\neq 1,$ so the possible values of $r$ are 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n We can write the equations above as \\begin{align} (k - 2) d &= 99 - r^{k - 2}, \\\\ kd &= 999 - r^k. \\end{align}Thus, $99 - r^{k - 2}$ is divisible by $k - 2,$ and $999 - r^k$ is divisible by $k.$ If $r = 2,$ then the only possible values of $k$ are 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.\n We find that none of these values work. If $r = 3,$ then the only possible values of $k$ are 4, 5, and 6.\n We find that none of these values work. If $r = 4,$ then the only possible values of $k$ is 4.\n We find that this value does not work. If $r = 4,$ then the only possible values of $k$ is 4.\n We find that this value does not work.\n Therefore, we must have $k = 3,$ so \\begin{align} d + r &= 99, \\\\ 3d + r^3 &= 999. \\end{align}From the first equation, $d = 99 - r.$  Substituting, we get \\[3(99 - r) + r^3 = 999,\\]so $r^3 - 3r - 702 = 0.$  This factors as $(r - 9)(r^2 + 9r + 78) = 0,$ so $r = 9,$ so $d = 90.$  Then $a_3 = 1 + 2 \\cdot 90 = 181$ and $c_3 = 9^2 = 81,$ and $c_3 = 181 + 81 = \\boxed{262}.$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes a b c :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> nat\"\nassumes h0 : \"\\<forall>n. n > 1 \\<longrightarrow> a n = a (n - 1) + 1\"\nand h1 : \"\\<forall>n. n > 1 \\<longrightarrow> b n = b (n - 1) * n\"\nand h2 : \"\\<forall>n. c n = a n + b n\"\nand h3 : \"c (k - 1) = 100\"\nand h4 : \"c (k + 1) = 1000\"\nshows  \"c k = 262\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
