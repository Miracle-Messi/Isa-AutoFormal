Case 1: Path ends in $C$-$B$. There are clearly four such paths, which we can determine systematically; $A$-$C$-$B$, $A$-$D$-$C$-$B$, $A$-$D$-$F$-$C$-$B$, and $A$-$D$-$E$-$F$-$C$-$B$.\n Case 2: Path ends in $F$-$B$. The possible paths are easy to determine systematically as $A$-$C$-$F$-$B$, $A$-$C$-$D$-$F$-$B$, $A$-$C$-$D$-$E$-$F$-$B$, $A$-$D$-$C$-$F$-$B$, $A$-$D$-$F$-$B$, $A$-$D$-$E$-$F$-$B$, yielding 6 possible paths.\n Therefore there are a total of $\\boxed{10}$ such paths.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes A B C D E F :: \"int \\<Rightarrow> int\"\nassumes h0 : \"A 0 = 0\"\nand h1 : \"B 0 = 0\"\nand h2 : \"C 0 = 0\"\nand h3 : \"D 0 = 0\"\nand h4 : \"E 0 = 0\"\nand h5 : \"F 0 = 0\"\nand h6 : \"continuous_paths A B C D E F\"\nshows  \"\\<exists> n. continuous_paths A B C D E F n \\<and> n = 10\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
