The complement is the set of 10-digit positive integers composed of the digits 1 and 2 with no two consecutive 1s.\n Counting such numbers is a popular combinatorial problem: we approach it via a recursion. There are two \"good\" one-digit numbers (1 and 2) and three good two-digit numbers (12, 21 and 22). Each such $n$-digit number is formed either by gluing \"2\" on to the end of a good $(n - 1)$-digit number or by gluing \"21\" onto the end of a good $(n - 2)$-digit number.\n This is a bijection between the good $n$-digit numbers and the union of the good $(n-1)$- and $(n - 2)$-digit numbers.\n Thus, the number of good $n$-digit numbers is the sum of the number of good $(n-1)$- and $(n - 2)$-digit numbers. The resulting recursion is exactly that of the Fibonacci numbers with initial values $F_1 = 2$ and $F_2 = 3$.\n Thus, our final answer is $2^{10} - F_{10} = 1024 - 144 = \\boxed{880}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes total_sequences :: nat\nassumes h0 : \"total_sequences = card {s :: nat list. length s = 10 \\<and> (\\<forall>n \\<in> set s. n = 1 \\<or> n = 2) \\<and> (\\<exists>i < 9. s ! i = 1 \\<and> s !
