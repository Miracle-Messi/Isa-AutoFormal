(We have to remember to include 600 at the end.)\n We can use any digit besides 5 for the tens and for the units digit, so we have 9 choices for each of these digits. This gives us a total of $5\\cdot 9\\cdot 9 = 405$ numbers less than 600 with no 5's.\n However, this count includes 000, and doesn't include 600. (Always be careful about extremes!) Including 600 and excluding 000, we still have 405 numbers less than 600 with no 5's, so we have $600-405 = \\boxed{195}$ numbers with at least one 5.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes f :: \"int \\<Rightarrow> bool\"\nassumes h0 : \"\\<forall> n. f n = (n \\<ge> 1 \\<and> n \\<le> 600 \\<and> (\\<exists> d. n mod 10 ^ d \\<ge> 5 * 10 ^ (d - 1) \\<and> n mod 10 ^ d < 6 * 10 ^ (d - 1)))\"\nshows  \"card {n. f n} = 195\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
