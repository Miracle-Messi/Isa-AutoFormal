The final Answer is 102\n ### Proof\n Since $E$ and $F$ are midpoints of the legs of the trapezoid, quadrilateral $EFCD$ is a trapezoid with half the altitude of the original trapezoid (the altitude of trapezoid $EFCD$ is $12/2 = 6$). The length of base $CD$ is still $20$, but now we have to find the length of base $EF$.\n Since $EF$ connects the midpoints of the legs of the trapezoid, its length is also the average of the lengths of $AB$ and $CD$.\n Thus, $EF$ has length $\\frac{8+20}{2} = 14$. Finally, we can find the area of the trapezoid with the formula $\\text{Area} = a \\left(\\frac{b_1+b_2}{2}\\right)$ where $a$ is the altitude and $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the bases.\n The area of trapezoid $EFCD $ is $6 \\left(\\frac{14+20}{2}\\right)=6 \\cdot 17 = \\boxed{102}$ square units.\n *)\n\ntheorem \nfixes A B C D E F :: real\nassumes h0 : \"B + C = 8\"\nand h1 : \"A + D = 20\"\nand h2 : \"E = (A + D)/2\"\nand h3 : \"F = (B + C)/2\"\nand h4 : \"E * 12 = F * 12\"\nshows  \"E * F = 102\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "Given that the sum of B and C is 8, the sum of A and D is 20, E is the average of A and D, F is the average of B and C, and 12 times E equals 12 times F, find the product of E and F. The final answer is 102."
