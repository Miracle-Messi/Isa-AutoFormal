For example, $5!=5\\cdot 4\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot 1= 120$.) The final Answer is 249\n ### Proof\n You get a digit $0$ on the end of a number whenever it has a factor of $10$, so the question is really asking, how many $10$s are in the prime factorization of $1000!$. Since $10=2\\cdot5$, we need to count how many of each there are.\n We're going to have more $2$s than $5$s, so we actually only need to count how many times $5$ appears in the prime factorization.\n To count how many times a number is divisible by $5$, we divide $1000$ by $5$ to get $200$. Each of those two hundred numbers has a factor of $5$. Next, how many of the numbers are divisible by $5^2=25$?\n Dividing $1000$ by $25$, we get $40$. Each of them has two factors of $5$.\n We've already counted one of them for each number, so for these forty multiples of $25$, we need to add a factor for each to our count. Next, we need to look at numbers that have $5^3=125$ in them. Eight of our numbers are divisible by $125$, so we count $8$ more factors of $5$.\n Finally, we look at $5^4=625$. There is only one number among $1$ through $1000$ divisible by $625$, and that number is $625$, so we only need to count one more factor of $5$. Since $5^5$ is too big, we can stop here.\n This gives a total of $200+40+8+1=249$ factors of $5$ in $1000!$, so it has $\\boxed{249}$ zeroes on the end.\n *)\n\nfunction factorial_zeroes :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> nat\"\nwhere\n\"factorial_zeroes n = (if n < 5 then 0 else (n div 5) + factorial_zeroes (n div 5))\"\nby pat_completeness auto\ntermination by (relation \"Wellfounded.measure (\\<lambda>n. n)\") auto\n\ntheorem\nshows  \"factorial_zeroes 1000 = 249\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
