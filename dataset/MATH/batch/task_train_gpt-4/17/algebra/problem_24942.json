Three identical point charges start at the vertices of an equilateral triangle, and this configuration stores 15 Joules of energy. How much more energy, in Joules, would be stored if one of these charges was moved to the midpoint of the opposite side? The final Answer is 10\n ### Proof\n Let the side length of the equilateral triangle be $d$. $15/3=5$ Joules of energy are stored when two charges are at distance $d$, so $2\\cdot5=10$ Joules are stored when they are at distance $d/2$, because energy is inversely proportional to distance.\n This means that in the second configuration, the pair $(A,C)$ and $(B,C)$ store 10 Joules each, and since $(A,B)$ still stores 5 Joules, the final configuration stores a total of $10+10+5=25$ Joules, which is $25-15=\\boxed{10}$ Joules more than the initial configuration.\n [asy] dot((0,0)); dot((2,0)); dot((1,1.732)); label(\"$A$\",(0,0),S); label(\"$B$\",(2,0),S); label(\"$C$\",(1,1.732),N); draw((3,.866)--(5,.866),EndArrow); dot((6,0)); dot((8,0)); dot((7,0)); label(\"$A$\",(6,0),S); label(\"$B$\",(8,0),S); label(\"$C$\",(7,0),S);\n [/asy]\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes E d q :: real\nassumes h0 : \"d > 0\"\nand h1 : \"q > 0\"\nand h2 : \"E = (k * q * q) / d\"\nand h3 : \"k > 0\"\nand h4 : \"\\<forall> x y. x + y = d \\<and> x > 0 \\<and> y > 0 \\<longrightarrow> E \\<le> (k * q * q) / x + (k * q * q) / y\"\nand h5 : \"E = 15\"\nshows  \"\\<forall> x y. x + y = d \\<and> x > 0 \\<and> y > 0 \\<longrightarrow> (k * q * q) / x + (k * q * q) / y - E \\<ge> 10\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "Suppose two point charges with the same positive charge $q$ are separated by a distance $d > 0$. The electrostatic energy $E$ between the charges is given by $E = \\frac{kq^2}{d}$, where $k > 0$ is a constant. If $E = 15$, find the smallest possible value of $\\frac{kq^2}{x} + \\frac{kq^2}{y} - E$ when the charges are moved to two new positions such that the sum of the distances $x$ and $y$ is still $d$, and both $x$ and $y$ are positive. The final answer is 10."
