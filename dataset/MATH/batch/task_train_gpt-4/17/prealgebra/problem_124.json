Including the corner posts, there are 7 posts on a side, which means that there are 6 five-foot gaps between posts.\n Altogether the length of a side is $7\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)+6(5)=32\\frac{1}{3}$ feet. The perimeter of the square is four times the side length, so the perimeter is $4\\cdot 32\\frac{1}{3}=\\boxed{129\\frac{1}{3}}$ feet.\n *)\n\nDue to the nature of the problem, it would be difficult to translate this exact problem into Isabelle language as it involves a visual element and specific real-world context.
