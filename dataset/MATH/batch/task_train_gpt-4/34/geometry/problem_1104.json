        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n Triangle $ABC$ has vertices $A(0, 8)$, $B(2, 0)$, $C(8, 0)$.  A line through $B$ cuts the area of $\\triangle ABC$ in half; find the sum of the slope and $y$-intercept of this line. The final Answer is -2\n ### Proof\n The line through $B$ that cuts the area of $\\triangle ABC$ in half is the median -- that is, the line through $B$ and the midpoint $M$ of $\\overline{AC}$. (This line cuts the area of the triangle in half, because if we consider $\\overline{AC}$ as its base, then the height of each of $\\triangle AMB$ and $\\triangle CMB$ is equal to the distance of point $B$ from the line through $A$ and $C$.\n These two triangles also have equal bases because $AM=MC$, so their areas must be equal.) The midpoint $M$ of $\\overline{AC}$ has coordinates $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(0+8),\\frac{1}{2}(8+0)\\right)=(4,4)$. The line through $B(2,0)$ and $M(4,4)$ has slope $\\frac{4-0}{4-2}=2$, and since this line passes through $B(2,0)$, it has equation $y-0=2(x-2)$ or $y=2x-4$.\n Finally, the desired sum of the slope and $y$-intercept is $2+(-4)=\\boxed{-2}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes A B C :: \"real * real\" \nand M :: \"real \\<Rightarrow> real\" \nand L :: \"real \\<Rightarrow> real\"\nassumes h0 : \"A = (0, 8)\"\nand h1 : \"B = (2, 0)\"\nand h2 : \"C = (8, 0)\"\nand h3 : \"\\<forall> x.
