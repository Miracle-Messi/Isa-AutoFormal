The multiplication table is completed and the sum of the nine entries is tabulated.  What is the largest possible sum of the nine entries?\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c||c|c|c|}\n\\times & a & b & c \\\\ \\hline \\hline\nd & & & \\\\ \\hline\ne & & & \\\\ \\hline\nf & & & \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\] The final Answer is 420\n ### Proof\n The sum of the nine entries is \\[ad + bd + cd + ae + be + ce + af + bf + cf = (a + b + c)(d + e + f).\\]Note that the sum $(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 = 41$ is fixed, so to maximize $(a + b + c)(d + e + f),$ we want the two factors to be as close as possible, i.e.\n $20 \\times 21 = 420.$\n We can achieve this by taking $\\{a,b,c\\} = \\{2,5,13\\}$ and $\\{d,e,f\\} = \\{3,7,11\\},$ so the maximum sum is $\\boxed{420}.$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes a b c d e f :: nat\nassumes h0 : \"set [a, b, c, d, e, f] = set [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]\"\nshows  \"a * d + a * e + a * f + b * d + b * e + b * f + c * d + c * e + c * f \\<le> 420\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
