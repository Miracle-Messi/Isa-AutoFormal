What is the remainder when $P(x)$ is divided by $(x - 19)(x - 99)$? The final Answer is -x + 118\n ### Proof\n By the Remainder Theorem, $P(19) = 99$ and $P(99) = 19.$\n When $P(x)$ is divided by $(x - 19)(x - 99),$ the remainder must be of the form $ax + b.$  Thus, \\[P(x) = (x - 19)(x - 99) Q(x) + ax + b,\\]for some polynomial $Q(x).$ Setting $x = 19$ and $x = 99,$ we get\n \\begin{align} 19a + b &= P(19) = 99, \\\\ 99a + b &= P(99) = 19. \\end{align}Subtracting the equations, we get $80a = -80,$ so $a = -1.$  Then $-19 + b = 99,$ so $b = 118.$  Hence, the remainder is $\\boxed{-x + 118}.$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes x :: real and P :: \"real \\<Rightarrow> real\"\nassumes h0 : \" \\<forall> x.

        "informal problem": "Consider a real-valued function $P(x)$. If for all $x$, the remainder of $P(x)$ divided by $(x-19)$ is $99$ and the remainder of $P(x)$ divided by $(x-99)$ is $19$, prove that for all $x$, the remainder of $P(x)$ divided by the product of $(x-19)$ and $(x-99)$ equals $-x+118$."
