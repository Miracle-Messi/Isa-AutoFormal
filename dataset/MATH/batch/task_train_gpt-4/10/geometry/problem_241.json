Since each interior angle of a regular hexagon is 120 degrees, this triangle is a 30-60-90 right triangle.\n Let $r$ be the radius of the circle. The length of the longer leg of the triangle is $r$, so the length of the shorter leg is $r/\\sqrt{3}$ and the length of the hypotenuse is $2r/\\sqrt{3}$. Since for the smaller hexagon the length of the segment connecting a vertex to the center is $r$, the dimensions of the larger hexagon are $2/\\sqrt{3}$ times larger than the dimensions of the smaller hexagon.\n Therefore, the area of the larger triangle is $(2/\\sqrt{3})^2=\\boxed{\\frac{4}{3}}$ times greater than the area of the smaller triangle.
