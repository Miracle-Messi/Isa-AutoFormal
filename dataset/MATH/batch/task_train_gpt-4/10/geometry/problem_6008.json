When the triangle is rotated about the other leg, the volume of the cone produced is $1920\\pi \\;\\textrm{ cm}^3$. What is the length (in cm) of the hypotenuse of the triangle?\n The final Answer is 26\n ### Proof\n Let one leg of the triangle have length $a$ and let the other leg have length $b$.\n When we rotate around the leg of length $a$, the result is a cone of height $a$ and radius $b$, and so of volume $\\frac 13 \\pi ab^2 = 800\\pi$. Likewise, when we rotate around the leg of length $b$ we get a cone of height $b$ and radius $a$ and so of volume $\\frac13 \\pi b a^2 = 1920 \\pi$.\n If we divide this equation by the previous one, we get $\\frac ab = \\frac{\\frac13 \\pi b a^2}{\\frac 13 \\pi ab^2} = \\frac{1920}{800} = \\frac{12}{5}$, so $a = \\frac{12}{5}b$. Then $\\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\left(\\frac{12}{5}b\\right)b^2 = 800\\pi$ so $b^3 = 1000$ and $b = 10$ so $a = 24$.\n Then by the Pythagorean Theorem, the hypotenuse has length $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \\boxed{26}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem \nfixes a b c :: real \nassumes h0 : \"pi * a powr 2 * b / 3 = 800 * pi\"\nand h1 : \"pi * b powr 2 * a / 3 = 1920 * pi\"\nand h2 : \"a powr 2 + b powr 2 = c powr 2\"\nshows  \"c = 26\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "Given that the volume of two different cones are 800\u03c0 cubic units and 1920\u03c0 cubic units respectively, where the base radius and height of the first cone are 'a' and 'b', and those of the second cone are 'b' and 'a'. Also, 'a' and 'b' are the legs of a right triangle with 'c' as the hypotenuse. Find the length of 'c'. The final answer is 26."
