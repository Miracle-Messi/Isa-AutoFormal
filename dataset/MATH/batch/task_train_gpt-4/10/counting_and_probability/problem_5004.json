        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n The numbers $1447$, $1005$ and $1231$ have something in common: each is a $4$-digit number beginning with $1$ that has exactly two identical digits. How many such numbers are there?\n The final Answer is 432\n ### Proof\n Suppose that the two identical digits are both $1$. Since the thousands digit must be $1$, only one of the other three digits can be $1$. This means the possible forms for the number are $11xy,\\qquad 1x1y,\\qquad1xy1$\n Because the number must have exactly two identical digits, $x\\neq y$, $x\\neq1$, and $y\\neq1$.\n Hence, there are $3\\cdot9\\cdot8=216$ numbers of this form.\n Now suppose that the two identical digits are not $1$. Reasoning similarly to before, we have the following possibilities: $1xxy,\\qquad1xyx,\\qquad1yxx.$\n Again, $x\\neq y$, $x\\neq 1$, and $y\\neq 1$. There are $3\\cdot9\\cdot8=216$ numbers of this form.\n Thus the answer is $216+216=\\boxed{432}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes count_identical_digits :: \"int \\<Rightarrow> int\"\nassumes h0 : \"count_identical_digits 1447 = 2\"\nand h1 : \"count_identical_digits 1005 = 2\"\nand h2 : \"count_identical_digits 1231 = 2\"\nshows  \"\\<exists> n. n = 432 \\<and> (\\<forall>k. k \\<ge> 1000 \\<and> k < 2000 \\<and> count_identical_digits k = 2 \\<longrightarrow> n = card {k})\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "How many integers between 1000 and 2000 have exactly 2 identical digits? Given that the function `count_identical_digits` returns the number of identical digits for an integer, and `count_identical_digits(1447) = 2`, `count_identical_digits(1005) = 2`, and `count_identical_digits(1231) = 2`, find the total number of such integers. The final answer is 432."
