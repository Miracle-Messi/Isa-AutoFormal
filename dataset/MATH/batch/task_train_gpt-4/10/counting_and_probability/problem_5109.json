        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n A scanning code consists of a $7 \\times 7$ grid of squares, with some of its squares colored black and the rest colored white. There must be at least one square of each color in this grid of $49$ squares. A scanning code is called $\\textit{symmetric}$ if its look does not change when the entire square is rotated by a multiple of $90 ^{\\circ}$ counterclockwise around its center, nor when it is reflected across a line joining opposite corners or a line joining midpoints of opposite sides.
