Isabelle is a general-purpose theorem prover that is not designed to handle specific real world problems involving graphs and contextual information.\n\nAn attempt to translate the given problem into an Isabelle version would be to define five variables for the number of games won by each team, and then represent the given conditions as assumptions. However, these assumptions would not include the graphical representation and would not be able to directly solve the problem. Therefore, the translation of such a problem to an Isabelle language version is not feasible.\n\nIsabelle can be used to prove theorems that are well defined in mathematical terms. For instance, it can be used to prove theorems in number theory, algebra, calculus, etc. However, it is not designed to solve problems that require interpretation of graphical or contextual information.\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",

However, the explanation provided seems to be explaining the limitations of Isabelle in dealing with problems that require graphical representations or involve a high degree of contextual information.
