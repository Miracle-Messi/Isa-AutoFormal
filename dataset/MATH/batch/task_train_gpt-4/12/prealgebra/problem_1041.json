The commentary discusses the limitations of the Isabelle language in solving a combinatorial problem. Specifically, it mentions the difficulty of representing an algorithmic solution or computation within Isabelle, which is primarily used for proving formal mathematical theorems. The example given is a problem of computing the number of two-digit numbers where the sum of their digits is a perfect square. While a function can be defined in Isabelle for this computation, it cannot be used to prove a theorem stating that this number is 17. This showcases the limitations of translating certain types of problems into Isabelle."
