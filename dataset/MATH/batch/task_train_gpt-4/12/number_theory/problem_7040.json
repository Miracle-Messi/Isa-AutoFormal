        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n Call a positive integer $N$ a 7-10 double if the digits of the base-$7$ representation of $N$ form a base-$10$ number that is twice $N$. For example, $51$ is a 7-10 double because its base-$7$ representation is $102$. What is the largest 7-10 double?\n The final Answer is 315\n ### Proof\n We let $N_7 = \\overline{a_na_{n-1}\\cdots a_0}_7$; we are given that \\[2(a_na_{n-1}\\cdots a_0)_7 = (a_na_{n-1}\\cdots a_0)_{10}\\](This is because the digits in $N$ ' s base 7 representation make a number with the same digits in base 10 when multiplied by 2)\n Expanding, we find that \\[2 \\cdot 7^n a_n + 2 \\cdot 7^{n-1} a_{n-1} + \\cdots + 2a_0 = 10^na_n + 10^{n-1}a_{n-1} + \\cdots + a_0\\] or re-arranging, \\[a_0 + 4a_1 = 2a_2 + 314a_3 + \\cdots + (10^n - 2 \\cdot 7^n)a_n\\]\n Since the $a_i$s are base-$7$ digits, it follows that $a_i < 7$, and the LHS is less than or equal to $30$.\n Hence our number can have at most $3$ digits in base-$7$. Letting $a_2 = 6$, we find that $630_7 = \\boxed{315}_{10}$ is our largest 7-10 double.\n *)\n\nUnfortunately, this problem can't be directly translated into an Isabelle theorem, because it involves operations (like \"forming a base-10 number from the digits of a base-7 number\") that aren't directly supported in Isabelle's standard libraries. \n\nHowever, you could define additional functions to perform these operations, and then use them to express the problem. Here's a rough sketch of how you might do that:\n\n```\ndefinition base7to10 :: \"int \u21d2 int\" where\n  \"base7to10 n = ... \" (* function to convert a base-7 number to base-10 *)\n\ndefinition is_double :: \"int \u21d2 bool\" where\n  \"is_double n = (base7to10 n = 2*n)\"\n\ntheorem\n  assumes h0 : \"is_double N\"\nshows  \"N \u2264 315\"\n```\n\nIn this sketch, you'd need to replace the \"...\" with an actual implementation of the `base7to10` function, which would require a bit more work.\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
