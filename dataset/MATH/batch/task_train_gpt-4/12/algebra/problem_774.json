The final Answer is 450\n ### Proof\n The fact that 60 workers produce 240 widgets and 300 whoosits in two hours implies that 100 workers produce 400 widgets and 500 whoosits in two hours, or 200 widgets and 250 whoosits in one hour.\n Let $a$ be the time required for a worker to produce a widget, and let $b$ be the time required for a worker to produce a whoosit. Then $300a + 200b = 200a + 250b$, which is equivalent to $b = 2a$. In three hours, 50 workers produce 300 widgets and 375 whoosits, so $150a + mb = 300a + 375b$ and $150a + 2ma = 300a + 750a$.\n Solving the last equation yields $m = \\boxed{450}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes widgets :: real and whoosits :: real\nassumes h0 : \"100 * 1 = 300 * widgets + 200 * whoosits\"\nand h1 : \"60 * 2 = 240 * widgets + 300 * whoosits\"\nand h2 : \"50 * 3 = 150 * widgets + m * whoosits\"\nshows  \"m = 450\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",

The first box can hold 100 widgets and 300 whoosits, the second box can hold 60 widgets and 240 whoosits, and the third box can hold 50 widgets and an unknown number of whoosits, represented by $m$. \n\nIf it takes 1 hour to fill the first box, 2 hours to fill the second box, and 3 hours to fill the third box, and the rate of packing widgets and whoosits is the same for all boxes, find the value of $m$ for which the third box holds the same number of whoosits as the first and second boxes combined.
