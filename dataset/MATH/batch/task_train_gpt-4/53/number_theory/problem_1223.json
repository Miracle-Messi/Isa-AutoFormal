        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n Find the smallest positive integer $N$ with the following property: of the three numbers $N$, $N+1$, and $N+2$, one of them is divisible by $2^2$, one of them is divisible by $3^2$, one is divisible by $5^2$, and one is divisible by $7^2$. The final Answer is 98\n ### Proof\n The most efficient means of searching for this trio of integers is to begin with the multiples of $7^2$. The first such number is 49, which almost works, since 50 is divisible by $5^2$ and 48 is divisible by $2^2$.\n But none of the nearby numbers is divisible by $3^2$, so we move on to the next multiple of $7^2$, which is 98.\n To our delight we discover that $3^2$ divides 99, while $2^2$ and $5^2$ divide 100.\n Hence we should take $N=\\boxed{98}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes N :: \"nat\"\nassumes h0 : \"(N mod 4 = 0) \\<or> (N mod 9 = 0) \\<or> (N mod 25 = 0) \\<or> (N mod 49 = 0)\"\nand h1 : \"((N+1) mod 4 = 0) \\<or> ((N+1) mod 9 = 0) \\<or> ((N+1) mod 25 = 0) \\<or> ((N+1) mod 49 = 0)\"\nand h2 : \"((N+2) mod 4 = 0) \\<or> ((N+2) mod 9 = 0) \\<or> ((N+2) mod 25 = 0) \\<or> ((N+2) mod 49 = 0)\"\nand h3 : \"N > 0\"\nshows  \"N = 98\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
