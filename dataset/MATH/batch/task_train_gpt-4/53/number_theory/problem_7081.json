Obviously, for $i\\in\\{1,2,\\dots,2009\\}$ the function $f(i)=2\\cdot 2009 - i - p(i!\n )$ is is a strictly decreasing function.\n Therefore $p(c) = p\\left( {2\\cdot 2009\\choose 2009} \\right) = 2009 - p(2009!)$.\n We can now compute $p(2009!) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\left\\lfloor \\dfrac{2009}{2^k} \\right\\rfloor = 1004 + 502 + \\cdots + 3 + 1 = 2001$.\n Hence $p(c)=2009-2001=8$. And thus we have $a=2\\cdot 2009 - p(c) = 4010$, and the answer is $\\dfrac{ab}{10} = \\dfrac{4010\\cdot 1}{10} = \\boxed{401}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes n :: nat and sum :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> nat\"\nassumes h0 : \"sum 1 = 1\"\nand h1 : \"sum 2009 = 2 powr a * b\"\nand h2 : \"even b\"\nand h3 : \"\\<forall> n. n \\<ge> 1 \\<and> n \\<le> 2009 \\<longrightarrow> sum (n + 1) = sum n + (2 * n - 1)!! / (2 * n)!!\"\nshows  \"a * b / 10 = 401\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "Given that the sum from 1 to $n$ of the fraction $\\frac{(2n - 1)!!}{(2n)!!}$ is represented by $sum(n)$, with $sum(1) = 1$ and $sum(2009) = 2^a \\cdot b$ where $b$ is an even number, find the value of $\\frac{a \\cdot b}{10}$. The final answer is $401$."
