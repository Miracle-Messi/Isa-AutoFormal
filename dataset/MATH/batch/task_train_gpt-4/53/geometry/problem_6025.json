        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n Euler's formula states that for a convex polyhedron with $V$ vertices, $E$ edges, and $F$ faces, $V-E+F=2$. A particular convex polyhedron has 32 faces, each of which is either a triangle or a pentagon. At each of its $V$ vertices, $T$ triangular faces and $P$ pentagonal faces meet. What is the value of $100P+10T+V$?\n The final Answer is 250\n ### Proof\n The convex polyhedron of the problem can be easily visualized; it corresponds to a dodecahedron (a regular solid with $12$ equilateral pentagons) in which the $20$ vertices have all been truncated to form $20$ equilateral triangles with common vertices.\n The resulting solid has then $p=12$ smaller equilateral pentagons and $t=20$ equilateral triangles yielding a total of $t+p=F=32$ faces. In each vertex, $T=2$ triangles and $P=2$ pentagons are concurrent.\n Now, the number of edges $E$ can be obtained if we count the number of sides that each triangle and pentagon contributes: $E=\\frac{3t+5p}{2}$, (the factor $2$ in the denominator is because we are counting twice each edge, since two adjacent faces share one edge).\n Thus, $E=60$. Finally, using Euler's formula we have $V=E-30=30$. In summary, the solution to the problem is $100P+10T+V=\\boxed{250}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes V E F T P :: nat\nassumes h0 : \"V - E + F = 2\"\nand h1 : \"F = T + P\"\nand h2 : \"3 * T + 5 * P = 2 * E\"\nshows  \"100 * P + 10 * T + V = 250\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "Given that the number of vertices, edges, and faces in a graph satisfy the equation $V - E + F = 2$, and the number of faces equals the sum of the number of triangles and pentagons, $F = T + P$. Moreover, it is known that $3T + 5P = 2E$. Find the value of $100P + 10T + V$. The final answer is 250."
