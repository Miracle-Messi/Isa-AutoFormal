The final Answer is 12\n ### Proof\n We will begin by finding all the positive factors of $-12$, which are the same as the positive factors of $12$. The positive factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. The four numbers we seek must be among these six numbers.\n Note that the number $4$ is not a factor of each number on the list, since dividing $114$ by $4$ gives a remainder of $2$.\n We also know that $12$ cannot be a factor of $114$, since dividing $114$ by $12$ gives a remainder of $6$.\n However, $6$ is a factor of each number on the list, since   \\begin{align} 36 &= 6 \\cdot 6\\\\ 72 &= 6 \\cdot 12\\\\ -12 &= 6 \\cdot (-2)\\\\ 96 &= 6 \\cdot 16\\\\ 114 &= 6 \\cdot 19 \\end{align}Since $1$, $2$, $3$, and $6$ are factors of $6$, and $6$ is a factor of each number on the list, $1$, $2$, $3$, and $6$ must be a factor of each number on the list.\n So these are the four numbers we were looking for, and our final answer is $$1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = \\boxed{12}.$$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes a b c d e :: int and divisors :: \"int set\"\nassumes h0 : \"a = 36\"\nand h1 : \"b = 72\"\nand h2 : \"c = -12\"\nand h3 : \"114\"\nand h4 : \"e = 96\"\nand h5 : \"divisors = {x. x > 0 \\<and> x dvd a \\<and> x dvd b \\<and> x dvd c \\<and> x dvd d \\<and> x dvd e}\"\nshows  \"sum id divisors = 12\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
