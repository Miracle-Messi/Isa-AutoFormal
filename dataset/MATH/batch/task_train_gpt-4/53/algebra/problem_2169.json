        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n Three of the four vertices of a rectangle are $(5, 11)$, $(16, 11)$ and $(16, -2)$. What is the area of the intersection of this rectangular region and the region inside the graph of the equation $(x - 5)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 9$? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$. The final Answer is \\frac94\\pi\n ### Proof\n The sides of the rectangle are parallel to the axes, so the fourth point must make a vertical line with (5,11) and a horizontal one with (16,-2); this means that the fourth point is (5,-2). The graph of the region inside the equation is a circle with radius 3 and center (5,-2): [asy]\n size(150); defaultpen(linewidth(.8pt)); fill(Arc((5,-2),3,0,90)--(5,-2)--cycle,gray); draw(Circle((5,-2),3)); draw((5,-2)--(16,-2)--(16,11)---(5,11)--cycle); [/asy] Since each angle of a rectangle is $90^{\\circ}$ and the corner coincides with the center of the circle, the rectangle covers exactly a quarter of the circle.\n The area of the intersection is thus $\\frac14r^2\\pi=\\frac14\\cdot3^2\\pi=\\boxed{\\frac94\\pi}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes A B C :: \"real * real\"\nand area_intersection :: real\nassumes h0 : \"A = (5, 11)\"\nand h1 : \"B = (16, 11)\"\nand h2 : \"C = (16, -2)\"\nand h3 : \"\\<forall>x y.
