Then the first $26$ sets ($S_0,\\cdots S_{25}$) each have at least one perfect square.\n Also, since $316^2 < 100000$ (which is when $i = 1000$), there are $316 - 50 = 266$ other sets after $S_{25}$ that have a perfect square. There are $1000 - 266 - 26 = \\boxed{708}$ sets without a perfect square.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes S :: \"int \\<Rightarrow> int set\"\nassumes h0 : \"\\<forall> i.

        "informal problem": "Define a series of sets $S_i$ for $i$ between 0 and 999, inclusive. Each set $S_i$ contains all the integers $n$ such that $100i \\leq n < 100(i + 1)$. Find how many sets $S_i$ do not contain a perfect square. The final answer is 708."
