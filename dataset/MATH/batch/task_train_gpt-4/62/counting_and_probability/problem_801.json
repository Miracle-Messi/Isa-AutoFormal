What is the minimum number of boxes a participant needs to eliminate in order to have a half chance of holding at least $\\$100,\\!000$ as his or her chosen box? The final Answer is 12\n ### Proof\n Seven of the boxes contain at least this amount. If a participant is going to be holding one of these boxes with a probability of $1/2,$ there can be at most $7$ other boxes left. This means that at least $26-7-7=\\boxed{12}$ boxes must be eliminated.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes n_boxes :: nat and prob :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> real\"\nassumes h0 : \"n_boxes = 26\"\nand h1 : \"prob n = card {x. x \\<in> {1..26} \\<and> x \\<ge> n} / n_boxes\"\nand h2 : \"prob n \\<ge> 1/2\"\nshows  \"n = 12\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "In a game, there are 26 boxes, numbered from 1 to 26. The probability of picking a box with a number greater than or equal to $n$ is given by $\\frac{\\text{number of boxes with numbers } \\geq n}{26}$. Find the smallest value of $n$ such that the probability is at least $\\frac{1}{2}$. The final answer is 12."
