If you spin the spinner three times and form a three-digit number from the three outcomes, such that the first outcome is the hundreds digit, the second outcome is the tens digit and the third outcome is the units digit, what is the probability that you will end up with a three-digit number that is divisible by 4?

Since each digit can occur in each of the three spins, there are $3^3 = 27$ possible integers.
