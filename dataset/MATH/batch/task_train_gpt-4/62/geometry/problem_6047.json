        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n Consider the parallelogram with vertices $(10,45)$, $(10,114)$, $(28,153)$, and $(28,84)$. A line through the origin cuts this figure into two congruent polygons. The slope of the line is $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\n The final Answer is 118\n ### Proof\n Let the first point on the line $x=10$ be $(10,45+a)$ where a is the height above $(10,45)$.\n Let the second point on the line $x=28$ be $(28, 153-a)$. For two given points, the line will pass the origin if the coordinates are proportional (such that $\\frac{y_1}{x_1} = \\frac{y_2}{x_2}$). Then, we can write that $\\frac{45 + a}{10} = \\frac{153 - a}{28}$.\n Solving for $a$ yields that $1530 - 10a = 1260 + 28a$, so $a=\\frac{270}{38}=\\frac{135}{19}$. The slope of the line (since it passes through the origin) is $\\frac{45 + \\frac{135}{19}}{10} = \\frac{99}{19}$, and the solution is $m + n = \\boxed{118}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes m n :: real\nassumes h0 : \"rel_prime m n\"\nand h1 : \"\\<exists>l. is_line l \\<and> l 0 = 0 \\<and> l 1 = m / n \\<and> congruent (parallelogram (10, 45) (10, 114) (28, 153) (28, 84)) (cut l (parallelogram (10, 45) (10, 114) (28, 153) (28, 84)))\"\nshows  \"m + n = 118\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
