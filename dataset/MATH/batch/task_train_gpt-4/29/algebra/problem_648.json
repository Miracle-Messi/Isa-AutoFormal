The final Answer is 32\n ### Proof\n The original graph consists of the points $(x_1,f(x_1)),$ $(x_2,f(x_2)),$ and $(x_3,f(x_3))$. The graph of $y=2f(2x)$ consists of the points $\\left(\\frac{x_1}2,2f(x_1)\\right),$ $\\left(\\frac{x_2}2,2f(x_2)\\right),$ and $\\left(\\frac{x_3}2,2f(x_3)\\right)$.\n Relative to the original graph, it is stretched vertically by a factor of $2$, but also compressed horizontally by the same factor. The vertical transformation doubles the area of the triangle formed by the three points, but the horizontal transformation halves it again, so the final area is equal to the original $\\boxed{32}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes f :: \"real \\<Rightarrow> real\"\nand x1 x2 x3 :: real\nand triangle_area :: \"real \\<Rightarrow> real \\<Rightarrow> real \\<Rightarrow> real\"\nassumes h0 : \"triangle_area f x1 x2 x3 = 32\"\nand h1 : \"triangle_area (2 * f) (2 * x1) (2 * x2) (2 * x3) = A\"\nshows  \"A = 32\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "Given that the area of a triangle with vertices defined by the function $f(x)$ and points $x_1, x_2,$ and $x_3$ is 32, find the area $A$ of the triangle with vertices defined by the function $2f(x)$ and points $2x_1, 2x_2,$ and $2x_3$. The final answer is 32."
