The final Answer is [0,3)\n ### Proof\n First we'll simplify that complicated expression.\n We attempt to factor the numerator of the left side: \\begin{align} pq^2+p^2q+3q^2+3pq &= q(pq + p^2 + 3q + 3p) \\\\ &= q[ p(q+p) + 3(q+p) ] \\\\ &= q(p+3)(q+p). \\end{align}Substituting this in for the numerator in our inequality gives $$\\frac{3q(p+3)(p+q)}{p+q}>2p^2q.$$We note that left hand side has $p+q$ in both the numerator and denominator.\n We can only cancel these terms if $p+q \\neq 0.$  Since we're looking for values of $p$ such that the inequality is true for all $q > 0,$ we need $p \\geq 0$ so that $p + q \\neq 0.$ Also because this must be true for every $q>0$, we can cancel the $q$'s on both sides.\n This gives  \\begin{align} 3(p+3)&>2p^2\\Rightarrow\\\\ 3p+9&>2p^2 \\Rightarrow\\\\ 0&>2p^2-3p-9. \\end{align}Now we must solve this quadratic inequality.\n We can factor the quadratic as $2p^2-3p-9=(2p+3)(p-3)$. The roots are $p=3$ and $p=-1.5$. Since a graph of this parabola would open upwards, we know that the value of $2p^2 - 3p - 9$ is negative between the roots, so the solution to our inequality is $-1.5<p<3.$  But we still need $0 \\leq p,$ so in interval notation the answer is $\\boxed{[0,3)}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes p q :: real\nassumes h0 : \"q > 0\"\nand h1 : \"3 * (p * q^2 + p^2 * q + 3 * q^2 + 3 * p * q) / (p + q) > 2 * p^2 * q\"\nshows  \"p \\<ge> 0 \\<and> p < 3\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
