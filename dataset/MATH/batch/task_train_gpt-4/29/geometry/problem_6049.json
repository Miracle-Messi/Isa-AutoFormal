        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n In the middle of a vast prairie, a firetruck is stationed at the intersection of two perpendicular straight highways. The truck travels at $50$ miles per hour along the highways and at $14$ miles per hour across the prairie. Consider the set of points that can be reached by the firetruck within six minutes. The area of this region is $m/n$ square miles, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$.\n The final Answer is 731\n ### Proof\n Let the intersection of the highways be at the origin $O$, and let the highways be the x and y axes.\n We consider the case where the truck moves in the positive x direction. After going $x$ miles, $t=\\frac{d}{r}=\\frac{x}{50}$ hours has passed. If the truck leaves the highway it can travel for at most $t=\\frac{1}{10}-\\frac{x}{50}$ hours, or $d=rt=14t=1.4-\\frac{7x}{25}$ miles.\n It can end up anywhere off the highway in a circle with this radius centered at $(x,0)$.
