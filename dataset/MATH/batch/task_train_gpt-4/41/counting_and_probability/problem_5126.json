Then there are ${8\\choose 3} = 56$ ways for Alpha to pick $3$ different items. Alpha purchases $2$ items, Beta $1$. Then there are ${8\\choose 2} = 28$ ways for Alpha to pick $2$ different items and there are $5$ ways for Beta to choose her oreo, with a total of $28 \\cdot 5 = 140$.\n Alpha purchases $1$ items, Beta $2$. Then there are $8$ ways for Alpha to pick $1$ different items. There are ${5\\choose 2} = 10$ ways for Beta to choose two distinct oreos, and $5$ ways for Beta to choose two oreos of the same flavor.\n This totals to $8 \\cdot (10+5) = 120$. Alpha purchases $0$ items, Beta $3$. There are ${5\\choose 3} = 10$ ways for Beta to choose three distinct oreos. For Beta to choose two oreos of the same flavor and another oreo, there are $5$ choices for the first and $4$ choices for the second, with a total of $20$ choices.\n There are $5$ ways to choose three of the same flavored oreo. This totals to $10 + 20 + 5 = 35$. The total is $56 + 140 + 120 + 35 = \\boxed{351}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes alpha_choices beta_choices total_choices :: nat\nassumes h0 : \"alpha_choices = 5\"\nand h1 : \"beta_choices = 3\"\nand h2 : \"total_choices = (binomial (alpha_choices + beta_choices) 3) * (binomial alpha_choices 1)\"\nshows  \"total_choices = 351\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
