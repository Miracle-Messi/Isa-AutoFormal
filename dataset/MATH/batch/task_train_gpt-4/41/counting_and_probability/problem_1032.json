A set of plates in which each possible sequence appears exactly once contains $N$ license plates. Find $\\frac{N}{10}$. The final Answer is 372\n ### Proof\n If a sequence contains no more than one 0, there are $7\\cdot 6\\cdot 5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3 = 2520$ sequences formed from the characters A, I, M, E, 2, 0, and 7. If a sequence contains two 0's, the 0's can be placed in $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ ways, the remaining characters can be chosen in $\\binom{6}{3} = 20$ ways, and those remaining characters can be arranged in $3!\n = 6$ ways, for a total of $10\\cdot 20\\cdot 6 = 1200$ sequences.\n Thus $N = 2520 + 1200 = 3720$, and $\\frac{N}{10}= \\boxed{372}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes AIME :: \"nat list\" and digits_2007 :: \"nat list\" and plates :: \"nat list list\" and N :: nat\nassumes h0 : \"AIME = [1, 2, 3, 4]\"\nand h1 : \"digits_2007 = [2, 0, 0, 7]\"\nand h2 : \"\\<forall>plate.

        "informal problem": "In how many ways can one arrange the four digits from the list $AIME = [1, 2, 3, 4]$ and the four digits from the list $digits_{2007} = [2, 0, 0, 7]$ to form a 5-digit number such that no two digits from the same list are consecutive? The final answer is 3720. Divide the final answer by 10 to get 372."
