        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n In the equation $w^3+x^3+y^3=z^3$, $w^3$, $x^3$, $y^3$, and $z^3$ are distinct, consecutive positive perfect cubes listed in ascending order. What is the smallest possible value of $z$? The final Answer is 6\n ### Proof\n Since $w$, $x$, $y$, and $z$ are consecutive positive integers, we can replace them with $x-1$, $x$ , $x+1$, and $x+2$.\n Substituting these into the equation, we have \\begin{align} (x-1)^3+x^3+(x+1)^3&=(x+2)^3 \\implies \\\\ (x^3-3x^2+3x-1)+x^3+(x^3+3x^2+3x+1)&=x^3+6x+12x^2+12 \\implies \\\\ 2x^3-6x^2-6x-8 &= 0 \\implies \\\\ x^3-3x^2-3x-4 &= 0.\n \\end{align} By the rational root theorem, the only possible rational solutions of the equation are $\\pm1$, $\\pm2$, and $\\pm4$. Since the question suggests that there are positive integer solutions, we try dividing $x^3-3x^2-3x-4$ by $(x-1)$, $(x-2)$ and $(x-4)$ using synthetic division.\n We find that $x^3-3x^2-3x-4=(x-4)(x^2+x+1)$. The quadratic factor does not factor further since its discriminant is $1^2-4\\cdot1\\cdot1=-3$.\n Therefore, $x=4$ is the only integer solution of the equation, which implies that $z=\\boxed{6}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes w x y z :: real\nassumes h0 : \"w powr 3 < x powr 3\"\nand h1 : \"x powr 3 < y powr 3\"\nand h2 : \"y powr 3 < z powr 3\"\nand h3 : \"z powr 3 = w powr 3 + x powr 3 + y powr 3\"\nshows  \"z = 6\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
