        "informal problem": "At an airport, there are a total of 12 gates, with each gate being 1200 feet apart from each other. You are currently at the departure gate and need to go to a new departure gate. The new departure gate is randomly chosen and is different from the current departure gate. What is the probability, expressed as a simplified fraction m/n, that the new departure gate is at least 400 feet away? Find the sum of m and n. The final answer is 52."
