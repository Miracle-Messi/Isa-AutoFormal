Let $m$ be the maximum number of red marbles for which such an arrangement is possible, and let $N$ be the number of ways he can arrange the $m+5$ marbles to satisfy the requirement. Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$.\n The final Answer is 3\n ### Proof\n We are limited by the number of marbles whose right hand neighbor is not the same color as the marble.\n By surrounding every green marble with red marbles - RGRGRGRGRGR. That's 10 \"not the same colors\" and 0 \"same colors.\"\n Now, for every red marble we add, we will add one \"same color\" pair and keep all 10 \"not the same color\" pairs. It follows that we can add 10 more red marbles for a total of $m = 16$.\n We can place those ten marbles in any of 6 \"boxes\": To the left of the first green marble, to the right of the first but left of the second, etc. up until to the right of the last. This is a stars-and-bars problem, the solution of which can be found as $\\binom{n+k}{k}$ where n is the number of stars and k is the number of bars.\n There are 10 stars (The unassigned Rs, since each \"box\" must contain at least one, are not counted here) and 5 \"bars,\" the green marbles.\n So the answer is $\\binom{15}{5} = 3003$, take the remainder when divided by 1000 to get the answer: $\\boxed{3}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes m N :: nat\nassumes h0 : \"\\<forall>arrangement. count_color_condition arrangement = (count_same_color arrangement = count_different_color arrangement)\"\nand h1 : \"max_red_marbles m\"\nand h2 : \"count_arrangements N (m + 5)\"\nshows  \"N mod 1000 = 3\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "Suppose there is a condition for arrangements of marbles such that the number of same color marbles equals the number of different color marbles. If there are a maximum of $m$ red marbles and there are $N$ arrangements satisfying the condition with $m + 5$ marbles, find the remainder when $N$ is divided by 1000. The final answer is 3."
