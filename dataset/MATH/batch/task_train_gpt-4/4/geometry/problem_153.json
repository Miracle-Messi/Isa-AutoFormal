When Leah walks 2.5 meters from the base of the pole toward the point where the cable is attached to the ground, her head just touches the cable. Leah is 1.5 meters tall. How many meters tall is the pole? The final Answer is 9\n ### Proof\n First, let us draw a diagram (not to scale! ): [asy] pair A,B,C,D,E; A=(0,0); B=(0,4.5); C=(6,0); D=(5,0); E=(5,0.75); draw(A--B--C--cycle); draw(D--E); label(\"A\",A,W); label(\"B\",B,W); label(\"C\",C+(0.4,0));\n label(\"D\",D, NW); label(\"E\",E+(0.3,0.2)); [/asy] Here, $AB$ is the telephone pole and $C$ is the point in the ground where the cable $BC$ is anchored. The key is to recognize that $ABC$ is a right triangle since the telephone pole is upright.\n Meanwhile, Leah stands at $D$ and touches the cable at $E,$ so $DEC$ is another right triangle. Not only that, but we see that $\\triangle ABC \\sim \\triangle DEC$ thanks to AA similarity.\n From the problem, We have that $DE = 1.5\\text{m},$ $AC = 3\\text{m},$ and $AD = 2.5\\text{m}.$ Therefore, $DC = AC - AD = 0.5\\text{m}.$ We desire $AB.$ From $\\triangle ABC \\sim \\triangle DEC,$ we get: \\begin{align}\n \\frac{AB}{AC} &= \\frac{DE}{DC} \\\\ \\frac{AB}{3\\text{m}} &= \\frac{1.5\\text{m}}{0.5\\text{m}} = 3 \\\\ AB &= 3 \\cdot 3\\text{m} = \\boxed{9}\\text{ meters}. \\end{align}\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes cable_length cable_base distance_leah pole_height :: real\nassumes h0 : \"cable_length = sqrt(pole_height^2 + cable_base^2)\"\nand h1 : \"cable_base = 3\"\nand h2 : \"distance_leah = 2.5\"\nand h3 : \"cable_length = sqrt((pole_height - 1.5)^2 + distance_leah^2)\"\nshows  \"pole_height = 9\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "Leah is standing 2.5 meters away from the base of a straight pole. The top of the pole has a cable attached to it. The cable goes straight down to the ground and the base of the cable is 3 meters away from the base of the pole. If the cable is just long enough to reach a height of 1.5 meters above Leah, what is the height of the pole? The answer is 9 meters."
