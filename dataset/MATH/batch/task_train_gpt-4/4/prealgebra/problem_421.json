Since the area of the larger circle is $64\\pi$ and $r>0,$ we have \\begin{align} \\pi r^2 &= 64\\pi \\\\ r^2 &= 64 \\\\ r &= \\sqrt{64} = 8. \\end{align}Since the smaller circle passes through the center of the larger circle and just touches the outer circle, by symmetry, its diameter must equal the radius of the larger circle.\n (In other words, if we join the center of the larger circle to the point where the two circles just touch, this line will be a radius of the larger circle and a diameter of the smaller circle.)\n Therefore, the diameter of the smaller circle is $8,$ so its radius is $4.$\n Therefore, the area of the smaller circle is $\\pi(4^2)=16\\pi,$ so the smaller shaded area is $\\frac{1}{2}\\times 16\\pi$ or $8\\pi.$\n Therefore, the total of the shaded areas is $32\\pi+8\\pi=\\boxed{40\\pi}.$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes pi :: real\nassumes h0 : \"pi > 0\"\nand h1 : \"let r_large = sqrt (64 * pi) / (2 * pi); r_small = r_large / 2 in \n           pi * (r_large^2 - r_small^2) = 40 * pi\"\nshows  \"True\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "Given that pi is a positive real number, suppose there are two circles with radii $r_{large} = \\sqrt{64\\pi}/2\\pi$ and $r_{small} = r_{large}/2$, respectively. If the area difference between the two circles equals $40\\pi$, this statement is true."
