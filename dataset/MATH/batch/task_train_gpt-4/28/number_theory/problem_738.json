Recall that the product of two numbers' LCM and GCD is equal to the product of the two numbers themselves: $$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]\\cdot \\gcd(a,b) = ab.$$This can be rearranged to give $$\\gcd(a,b) = \\frac{ab}{\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]}.$$In this case, we know that $a<10^6$ and $b<10^6$, so $ab<10^{12}$.\n We also know that $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]\\ge 10^9$, since the smallest 10-digit number is $10^9$.\n Therefore, $$\\gcd(a,b) < \\frac{10^{12}}{10^9} = 10^3,$$so $\\gcd(a,b)$ has at most $\\boxed{3}$ digits. (We should check that there are actual integers $a$ and $b$ for which $\\gcd(a,b)$ has $3$ digits. There are; for example, we can take $a=500{,}000$ and $b=200{,}100$, in which case the least common multiple is $1{,}000{,}500{,}000$ and the greatest common divisor is $100$.)\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes a b :: int\nassumes h0 : \"100000 \\<le> a\"\nand h1 : \"a < 1000000\"\nand h2 : \"100000 \\<le> b\"\nand h3 : \"b < 1000000\"\nand h4 : \"1000000000 \\<le> lcm a b\"\nand h5 : \"lcm a b < 10000000000\"\nshows  \"gcd a b < 1000\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
