Each edge has one cube that has $2$ faces painted red. There are $12$ edges, so $12$ cubes have $2$ faces painted red. Each of the six faces has only the center cube painted on exactly $1$ face, and the single cube in the center of the three-inch cube is the only one with no faces painted.\n We can thus produce the following table: $$ \\begin{array}{|c|c|} \\hline \\textbf{Number of red faces} & \\textbf{Number of one-inch cubes} \\\\ \\hline \\ast3 & 8 \\\\ \\hline \\ast2 & 12 \\\\ \\hline 1 & 6 \\\\ \\hline\n 0 & 1 \\\\ \\hline \\multicolumn{2}{|r|}{ \\text{Total = 27}}\\\\ \\hline \\end{array} $$$\\ast$ Number of cubes with $2$ or $3$ red faces is $8 + 12 = \\boxed{20}.$\n *)\n\nThe problem is a geometry problem that involves visual representation and understanding. It is difficult to convert it into a form suitable for Isabelle/HOL. However, we can still describe the problem in a logical manner as follows:\n\ndefinition \"Cube = {1..27}\"\n\ndefinition \"RedFace n = (n mod 3 = 1 \\<or> n mod 3 = 2)\"\n\ndefinition \"RedCube n = (card {m. m \\<in> Cube \\<and> RedFace m} \\<ge> 2)\"\n\ntheorem shows  \"card {n. n \\<in> Cube \\<and> RedCube n} = 20\"\n\nPlease note that this Isabelle/HOL representation of the problem is quite abstract and might not completely represent the original problem.\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "Consider a cube that is built from 27 smaller cubes (a 3x3x3 cube). We color some faces of the smaller cubes red. A smaller cube is considered a \"red cube\" if it has at least two of its faces colored red. If we denote by \"Cube\" the set of all smaller cubes and by \"RedCube\" the set of all \"red cubes\", then the problem is to find the number of \"red cubes\". The answer is 20."
