        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n Let $P$ be a point outside of circle $O.$ A segment is drawn from $P$ such that it is tangent to circle $O$ at point $T.$ Meanwhile, a secant from $P$ intersects $O$ at $A$ and $B,$ such that $PA < PB.$ If $PA = 3$ and $PT = AB - PA,$ then what is $PB$? The final Answer is 12\n ### Proof\n First of all, we see that $PB = PA + AB = 3 + AB.$ By Power of a Point, we know that $(PA)(PB) = (PT)^2,$ so we have $3(PB) = (AB - 3)^2.$ [asy] unitsize(2 cm); pair A, B, O, P, T; T = dir(70); P = T + dir(-20);\n B = dir(150); O = (0,0); A = intersectionpoint(P--interp(P,B,0.9),Circle(O,1)); draw(Circle(O,1)); draw(T--P--B); label(\"$A$\", A, SW); label(\"$B$\", B, NW); dot(\"$O$\", O, S); label(\"$P$\", P, E); label(\"$T$\", T, NE);\n [/asy]\n Let us define $x$ such that $x = PB = 3 + AB,$ then $AB = x - 3.$ Substituting, we now have $3x = (x - 6)^2.$ Then, we see that $3x = x^2 - 12x + 36,$ so $x^2 - 15x + 36 = 0.$ Factoring, we have $(x - 3)(x - 12) = 0$ so $x = 3$ or $x = 12,$ but we are given that $PA < PB,$ so $x > 3.$ That means our only answer for $x,$ hence $PB,$ is $\\boxed{12}.$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes PA PB PT AB :: real\nassumes h0 : \"PA < PB\"\nand h1 : \"PA = 3\"\nand h2 : \"PT = AB - PA\"\nshows  \"PB = 12\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
