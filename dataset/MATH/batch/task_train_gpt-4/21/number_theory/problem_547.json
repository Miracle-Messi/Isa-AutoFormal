Express your answer in base $10$. The final Answer is 58\n ### Proof\n Let the given base $7$ number be $n$. Suppose that $n$ has $d+1$ digits in either base $7$ or base $16$.\n Let $a_d$ be the leftmost digit of $n$ in its base $7$ expression, $a_{d-1}$ be the digit that is second from the left, and so forth, so that $a_0$ is the base $7$ units digit of $n$. It follows that $a_d$ is the base $16$ units digit of $n$, and so forth.\n Converting to base $10$, it follows that $$n = 7^d \\cdot a_d + 7^{d-1} \\cdot a_{d-1} + \\cdots + a_0 = 16^d \\cdot a_0 + 16^{d-1} \\cdot a_1 + \\cdots + a_d.$$Combining the like terms, it follows that $$(16^d - 1)a_0 + (16^{d-1} - 7)a_1 + \\cdots + (1 - 7^d)a_d = 0.$$For $d \\le 3$, we observe that the powers of $16$ are significantly larger than the powers of $7$.\n More precisely, since $a_i \\le 6$ for each $i$, then we have the following loose bound from the geometric series formula \\begin{align} 0 &= (16^d - 1)a_0 + (16^{d-1} - 7)a_1 + \\cdots + (1 - 7^d)a_d \\\\ &\\ge (16^d - 1) + (1 - 7) \\cdot 6 + \\cdots + (1-7^d) \\cdot 6 \\\\\n &= 16^d + d - 6 \\cdot \\frac{7^{d+1} - 1}{7 - 1} \\\\ &\\ge 16^d - 7^{d+1} \\\\ \\end{align}For $d = 3$, then $16^3 = 4096 > 7^4 = 2401$, and by induction, $16^d > 7^{d+1}$ for all $d \\ge 3$.\n Thus, $d \\in \\{0,1,2\\}$. If $d = 0$, then all values will work, namely $n = 1,2,3,4,5,6$. If $d = 1$, then $$(16 - 1)a_0 + (1-7)a_1 = 15a_0 - 6a_1 = 3(5a_0 - 2a_1) = 0.$$Thus, $5a_0 = 2a_1$, so $5$ divides into $a_1$.\n As $a_1 \\le 6$, then $a_1 = 0,5$, but the former yields that $n = 0$.\n Thus, we discard it, giving us the number $n = 52_7 = 5 \\cdot 7 + 2 = 37$. For $d=2$, we obtain that $$(256 - 1)a_0 + (16 - 7)a_1 + (1 - 49)a_2 = 3(51a_0 + 3a_1 - 16a_2) = 0.$$Since $16a_2 \\le 6 \\cdot 16 = 96$, then $a_0 = 1$.\n Then, $51 + 3a_1 = 3(17 + a_1) = 16a_2$, so it follows that $a_2$ is divisible by $3$.\n Thus, $a_2 = 0,3,6$, but only $a_2 = 6$ is large enough. This yields that $a_1 = 15$, which is not possible in base $7$.\n Thus, the sum of the numbers satisfying the problem statement is equal to $1+2+3+4+5+6+37 = \\boxed{58}.$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes n :: nat and b7 b16 :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> nat\"\nassumes h0 : \"\\<forall>n. b7 n = (n in base 7)\"\nand h1 : \"\\<forall>n. b16 n = (n in base 16)\"\nand h2 : \"\\<forall>n. b7 n > 0 \\<and> b7 n = reverse (b16 n)\"\nshows  \"sum b7 {n. b7 n > 0 \\<and> b7 n = reverse (b16 n)} = 58\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
