However, if we convert the bar graph data into a list of tuples representing the number of home runs each player hit in each month, we can then work with this list in Isabelle. Here's an example of how you might set up this problem:\n\n```\ndatatype Player = McGwire | Sosa\n\ntype_synonym Month = int\n\ntype_synonym HomeRuns = int\n\ndatatype Stat = Stat Player Month HomeRuns\n\ndefinition stats :: \"Stat list\" where\n\"stats = [Stat McGwire 3 1, Stat Sosa 3 0, Stat McGwire 4 10, Stat Sosa 4 6, Stat McGwire 5 16, Stat Sosa 5 7, Stat McGwire 6 10, Stat Sosa 6 20, Stat McGwire 7 8, Stat Sosa 7 9, Stat McGwire 8 10, Stat Sosa 8 13, Stat McGwire 9 15, Stat Sosa 9 11]\"\n\nfun total_runs :: \"Player \\<Rightarrow> Month \\<Rightarrow> Stat list \\<Rightarrow> HomeRuns\" where\n\"total_runs p m [] = 0\" |\n\"total_runs p m (Stat p' m' h # t) = (if p = p' \\<and> m' \\<le> m then h else 0) + total_runs p m t\"\n\ntheorem\nshows  \"THE m. total_runs McGwire m stats = total_runs Sosa m stats = 8\"\n```\n\nIn this setup, we've defined a datatype `Player` to represent the two players, a type synonym `Month` for the months represented as integers, and a type synonym `HomeRuns` for the number of home runs. We've created a datatype `Stat` to represent a statistic, which includes a player, a month, and the number of home runs. We then define a list of these `Stat` objects to represent the data from the bar graph. Finally, we define a function `total_runs` to calculate the total number of home runs a player has hit up to a certain month, and a theorem that states that the two players are tied in August (represented by the integer 8).\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "In a baseball season, players McGwire and Sosa hit the following number of home runs each month: \n\n- In March, McGwire hit 1 home run and Sosa hit 0. \n- In April, McGwire hit 10 home runs and Sosa hit 6. \n- In May, McGwire hit 16 home runs and Sosa hit 7. \n- In June, McGwire hit 10 home runs and Sosa hit 20. \n- In July, McGwire hit 8 home runs and Sosa hit 9. \n- In August, McGwire hit 10 home runs and Sosa hit 13. \n- In September, McGwire hit 15 home runs and Sosa hit 11.\n\nFind the month (represented as an integer from 1 to 12) in which the total number of home runs hit by each player up to and including that month is the same.
