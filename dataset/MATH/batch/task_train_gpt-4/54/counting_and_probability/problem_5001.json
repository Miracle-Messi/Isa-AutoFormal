This gives $2a_n$ outcomes. Otherwise, the first $n$ rolls do not multiply to a perfect square ($5^n - a_n$ outcomes).\n In this case, we claim that the last roll is uniquely determined (either 2, 3, or 6). If the product of the first $n$ rolls is $2^x 3^y$ where $x$ and $y$ are not both even, then we observe that if $x$ and $y$ are both odd, then the last roll must be 6; if only $x$ is odd, the last roll must be 2, and if only $y$ is odd, the last roll must be 3.\n Thus, we have $5^n - a_n$ outcomes in this case, and $a_{n+1} = 2a_n + (5^n - a_n) = 5^n + a_n$. Computing $a_2$, $a_3$, $a_4$ gives $a_2 = 7$, $a_3 = 32$, and $a_4 = 157$.\n Thus for Case 3, there are 157 outcomes. For case 2, we multiply by $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ to distribute the two 5's among four rolls.\n Thus the probability is \\[\\frac{1 + 6 \\cdot 7 + 157}{6^4} = \\frac{200}{6^4} = \\frac{25}{162} \\implies m+n = \\boxed{187}.\\]\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes prob :: \"real \\<Rightarrow> real\"\nassumes h0 : \"prob = (\\<lambda>x. x / 6 powr 4)\"\nand h1 : \"prob m = m / 1296\"\nand h2 : \"prob n = n / 216\"\nand h3 : \"m and n are relatively prime positive integers\"\nshows  \"m + n = 187\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
