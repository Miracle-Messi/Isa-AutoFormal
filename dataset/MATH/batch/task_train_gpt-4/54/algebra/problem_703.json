The final Answer is 15\n ### Proof\n Since $f(11)=34$, we know that $f(34)$ is defined, and it must equal $17$.\n Similarly, we know that $f(17)$ is defined, and it must equal $52$. Continuing on this way, \\begin{align} f(52)&=26\\\\ f(26)&=13\\\\ f(13)&=40\\\\ f(40)&=20\\\\ f(20)&=10\\\\ f(10)&=5\\\\ f(5)&=16\\\\ f(16)&=8\\\\ f(8)&=4\\\\\n f(4)&=2\\\\ f(2)&=1\\\\ f(1)&=4 \\end{align}We are now in a cycle $1$, $4$, $2$, $1$, and so on.\n Thus there are no more values which need to be defined, as there is no $a$ currently defined for which $f(a)$ is a $b$ not already defined.\n Thus the minimum number of integers we can define is the number we have already defined, which is $\\boxed{15}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes f :: \"int \\<Rightarrow> int\" and a b :: int\nassumes h0 : \"f 11 = 34\"\nand h1 : \"\\<forall> a b. f a = b \\<longrightarrow> (even b \\<longrightarrow> f b = b div 2) \\<and> (odd b \\<longrightarrow> f b = 3 * b + 1)\"\nshows  \"card (dom f) \\<ge> 15\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "Consider a function $f$ such that $f(11) = 34$. The function follows the rule: if $f(a) = b$, then when $b$ is even, $f(b) = \\frac{b}{2}$, and when $b$ is odd, $f(b) = 3b + 1$. Find the smallest number of distinct elements in the domain of $f$ such that this condition is satisfied. The final answer is greater than or equal to 15."
