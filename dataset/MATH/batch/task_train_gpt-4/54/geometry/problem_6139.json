        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n In $\\triangle{ABC}, AB=10, \\angle{A}=30^\\circ$ , and $\\angle{C=45^\\circ}$. Let $H, D,$ and $M$ be points on the line $BC$ such that $AH\\perp{BC}$, $\\angle{BAD}=\\angle{CAD}$, and $BM=CM$. Point $N$ is the midpoint of the segment $HM$, and point $P$ is on ray $AD$ such that $PN\\perp{BC}$. Then $AP^2=\\dfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\n The final Answer is 77\n ### Proof\n [asy] unitsize(20); pair A = MP(\"A\",(-5sqrt(3),0)), B = MP(\"B\",(0,5),N), C = MP(\"C\",(5,0)), M = D(MP(\"M\",0.5(B+C),NE)), D = MP(\"D\",IP(L(A,incenter(A,B,C),0,2),B--C),N), H = MP(\"H\",foot(A,B,C),N), N = MP(\"N\",0.5(H+M),NE), P = MP(\"P\",IP(A--D,L(N,N-(1,1),0,10))); D(A--B--C--cycle); D(B--H--A,blue+dashed); D(A--D); D(P--N); markscalefactor = 0.05; D(rightanglemark(A,H,B)); D(rightanglemark(P,N,D)); MP(\"10\",0.5(A+B)-(-0.1,0.1),NW); [/asy]\n Let us just drop the perpendicular from $B$ to $AC$ and label the point of intersection $O$.\n We will use this point later in the problem. As we can see, $M$ is the midpoint of $BC$ and $N$ is the midpoint of $HM$ $AHC$ is a $45-45-90$ triangle, so $\\angle{HAB}=15^\\circ$. $AHD$ is $30-60-90$ triangle.\n $AH$ and $PN$ are parallel lines so $PND$ is $30-60-90$ triangle also. Then if we use those informations we get $AD=2HD$ and $PD=2ND$ and $AP=AD-PD=2HD-2ND=2HN$ or $AP=2HN=HM$\n Now we know that $HM=AP$, we can find for $HM$ which is simpler to find.\n We can use point $B$ to split it up as $HM=HB+BM$, We can chase those lengths and we would get $AB=10$, so $OB=5$, so $BC=5\\sqrt{2}$, so $BM=\\dfrac{1}{2} \\cdot BC=\\dfrac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2}$\n We can also use Law of Sines: \\[\\frac{BC}{AB}=\\frac{\\sin\\angle A}{\\sin\\angle C}\\]\\[\\frac{BC}{10}=\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}\\implies BC=5\\sqrt{2}\\] Then using right triangle $AHB$, we have $HB=10 \\sin 15^\\circ$\n So $HB=10 \\sin 15^\\circ=\\dfrac{5(\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2})}{2}$. And we know that $AP = HM = HB + BM = \\frac{5(\\sqrt6-\\sqrt2)}{2} + \\frac{5\\sqrt2}{2} = \\frac{5\\sqrt6}{2}$. Finally if we calculate $(AP)^2$. $(AP)^2=\\dfrac{150}{4}=\\dfrac{75}{2}$.\n So our final answer is $75+2=77$. $m+n=\\boxed{77}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes A B C H D M N P :: \"real^2\"\nassumes h0 : \"dist A B = 10\"\nand h1 : \"angle A = 30\"\nand h2 : \"angle C = 45\"\nand h3 : \"H \\<in> {B--C}\"\nand h4 : \"D \\<in> {B--C}\"\nand h5 : \"M \\<in> {B--C}\"\nand h6 : \"N \\<in> {H--M}\"\nand h7 : \"P \\<in> {A--D}\"\nand h8 : \"orthogonal (A - H) (B - C)\"\nand h9 : \"angle B A D = angle C A D\"\nand h10 : \"dist B M = dist C M\"\nand h11 : \"orthogonal (P - N) (B - C)\"\nand h12 : \"dist A P powr 2 = m / n\"\nand h13 : \"coprime m n\"\nshows  \"m + n = 77\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
