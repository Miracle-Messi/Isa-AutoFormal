        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n Let $f(n)$ be the sum of the positive integer divisors of $n$. For how many values of $n$, where $1 \\le n \\le 25$, is $f(n)$ prime? The final Answer is 5\n ### Proof\n If $n$ is prime, then $f(n) = n+1$. If $n+1$ is prime, then $n$ must be even.\n Therefore, the only prime value of $n$ for which $n+1$ is prime is $n = 2$. If $n = p^a$ for some prime $p$ and an integer $a > 1$, then $f(n) = \\frac{p^{a+1}-1}{p-1}$. This value is not guaranteed to be composite, so we must check all powers of primes.\n Checking powers of $2$ first, $f(4) = 7$, $f(8) = 15$, and $f(16) = 31$. Two of these powers of 2 work. Checking powers of $3$, $f(9) = 13$ and $f(27)$ is beyond our boundary for $n$, so one power of $3$ works.\n Finally, $f(25) = 31$, which gives one more value of $n$ that works.
