If $BY = 16$ units, and $CX = 28$ units, what is the length of hypotenuse $BC$? Express your answer in simplest radical form. The final Answer is 6\\sqrt{26}\n ### Proof\n Let $AB = x$ and $AC = y$. Then we can write two Pythagorean equations from the information given: $(x/3)^2 + y^2 = 28^2$ and $x^2 + (y/3)^2 = 16^2$. These equations become $x^2/9 + y^2 = 784$ and $x^2 + y^2/9 = 256$.\n Multiplying them both by 9, we get $x^2 + 9y^2= 7056$ and $9x^2 + y^2 = 2304$.\n Now we add the two equations to get $10x^2 + 10y^2 = 9360$, which can be reduced to $x^2 + y^2 = 936$.\n We do not need to solve for $x$ and $y$ since 936 is the square of the hypotenuse $BC$. The length is thus $\\sqrt{936} = \\sqrt{(36 \\times 26)} = \\sqrt{36} \\times \\sqrt{26} = \\boxed{6\\sqrt{26}}$ units.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes A B C X Y :: \"real*real\" and BY CX BC :: real\nassumes h0 : \"is_right_angle A B C\"\nand h1 : \"X \\<in> closed_segment A B\"\nand h2 : \"Y \\<in> closed_segment A C\"\nand h3 : \"dist A X / dist X B = dist A Y / dist Y C = 1/2\"\nand h4 : \"dist B Y = 16\"\nand h5 : \"dist C X = 28\"\nshows  \"BC = 6 * sqrt 26\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
