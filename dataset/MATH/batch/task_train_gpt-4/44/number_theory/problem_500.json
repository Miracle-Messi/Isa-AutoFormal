In dollars, how much are the leftover quarters and dimes worth? The final Answer is \\$5.50\n ### Proof\n We use residues of the numbers of each type of coin to determine the number of dimes and quarters leftover: $$ \\begin{array}{rcrcr} 83 + 129 &\\equiv& 3 + 9 &\\equiv& 12 \\pmod{40} \\\\ 159 + 266 &\\equiv& 9 + 16 &\\equiv& 25 \\pmod{50} \\end{array} $$ The total value of the leftover quarters and dimes is $$ 12(\\$0.25) + 25(\\$0.10) = \\$3.00 + \\$2.50 = \\boxed{\\$5.50}.\n $$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes quarters_in_roll dimes_in_roll quarters_james dimes_james quarters_lindsay dimes_lindsay left_quarters left_dimes :: nat\nassumes h0 : \"quarters_in_roll = 40\"\nand h1 : \"dimes_in_roll = 50\"\nand h2 : \"quarters_james = 83\"\nand h3 : \"dimes_james = 159\"\nand h4 : \"quarters_lindsay = 129\"\nand h5 : \"dimes_lindsay = 266\"\nand h6 : \"left_quarters = (quarters_james + quarters_lindsay) mod quarters_in_roll\"\nand h7 : \"left_dimes = (dimes_james + dimes_lindsay) mod dimes_in_roll\"\nshows  \"(real (left_quarters) / 4) + (real (left_dimes) / 10) = 5.5\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "James has 83 quarters and 159 dimes. Lindsay has 129 quarters and 266 dimes. A roll of quarters contains 40 quarters and a roll of dimes contains 50 dimes. After they each wrap as many full rolls as possible, how much money in dollars do they have left outside of the rolls? The final answer is $5.50."
