        "informal problem": "A truck travels at a speed of $t$ km/h for a certain time. If it increases its speed to $3t$ km/h, it would cover the same distance in 200 km less. If it decreases its speed to $t$ km/h, it would cover the same distance in 200 km more. Find the sum of the numerator and the denominator of the fraction $t$ when expressed as a reduced fraction. The final answer is 163."

        "informal problem": "Jenny and Kenny are running around two parallel paths that are 200 meters apart. Jenny runs at a constant speed of 1 meter per second, while Kenny runs at a constant speed of 3 meters per second. There is a building with a diameter of 100 meters between the paths, and the distance from the building's midpoint to the path is at most half the distance between the paths. When Jenny and Kenny are 200 meters away from each other, how long will it take for them to meet, expressed as a fraction of the form $\\frac{q_1}{q_2}$, where $q_1$ and $q_2$ are coprime integers? Find the sum of $q_1$ and $q_2$. The final answer is $163$."
