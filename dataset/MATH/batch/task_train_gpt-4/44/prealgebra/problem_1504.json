Ignoring the colon, how many different palindromes are possible on a 12-hour digital clock displaying only the hours and minutes? (Notice a zero may not be inserted before a time with a single-digit hour value. Therefore, 01:10 may not be used.) The final Answer is 57\n ### Proof\n First, consider the three-digit palindromes. There are $9$ choices for the first digit (the hour): $1$, $2$,..., $9$. There are $6$ choices for the second digit (the tens digit of the minutes): $0$, $1$, ..., $5$.\n The last digit (the units digit of the minutes) has to be the same as the first digit.\n So there are $9 \\cdot 6 = 54$ three-digit palindromes. Second, consider the four-digit palindromes. The first digit (the tens digit of the hour) must be $1$. There are $3$ choices for the second digit (the units digit of the hour): $0$, $1$, and $2$.\n The third digit must be the same as the second digit, and the fourth digit must be the same as the first digit.\n So there are $3$ four-digit palindromes.
