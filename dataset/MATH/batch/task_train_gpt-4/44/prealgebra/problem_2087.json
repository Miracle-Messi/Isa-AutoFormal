But since circle $A$ is tangent to circle $B$ at $C$, we also have that $AB \\perp l$.\n Hence $A$ is on segment $BC$, and $BC$ is a diameter of circle $A$.\n Thus by homothety circle $A$ covers $\\frac{1}{4}$ the area of circle $B$. The shaded region is thus $\\frac{3}{4}$ of the area of circle $B$, and hence is 3 times the area of circle $A$, or simply $(\\pi \\cdot 3^2)\\cdot 3 = 27\\pi$.\n *)\n\ntheorem \nfixes A B C :: point and r1 r2 :: real\nassumes h0 : \"A = B + (of_real r1) *\\<^sub>R C\"\nand h1 : \"r1 = 6\"\nand h2 : \"r2 = 3\"\nand h3 : \"dist B C = r1\"\nshows  \"area (circle A r2) - area (circle B r1) = 27*pi\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "Given two circles, one with center A and radius r2, and the other with center B and radius r1. Point A is located at a distance of r1 along the direction of C from point B. Given that r1 is 6, r2 is 3, and the distance between B and C is equal to r1, find the difference in area between the two circles. The final answer is $27\\pi$."
