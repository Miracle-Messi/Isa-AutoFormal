The final Answer is \\sqrt{21}\n ### Proof\n We draw and label a diagram as follows: [asy] size(110); pair O = (0,0); pair A = (.3,.94); pair B = (.3,.075); draw(O--A--B--cycle,heavycyan); label(\"$O$\",O,W); label(\"$A$\",A,N); label(\"$B$\",B,S); import solids; import three; defaultpen(linewidth(0.8)); currentprojection = orthographic(5,0,1.3);\n revolution c = cylinder((0,0,0), .4, .91); draw(c,black); draw(scale(1,.25)*arc((0,0),1,0,180),dashed); draw(scale(1,.25)*arc((0,0),1,180,360)); draw(Arc((0,0),1,0,180)); [/asy]\n Let the center of the hemisphere be $O$, and let $A$ be a point on the circumference of the top circle of the cylinder. Since the cylinder is inscribed in the hemisphere, $A$ lies on the hemisphere as well, so $OA=5$.\n We drop a perpendicular from $A$ to the base of the hemisphere and let it intersect the base of the hemisphere at $B$. Since the cylinder is right and $AB$ is a height of the cylinder, $\\angle OBA$ is a right angle, and $B$ lies on the circumference of the bottom circle of the cylinder.\n Thus, $OB$ is a radius of the cylinder, so $OB=2$.\n We have that $\\triangle OBA$ is right, so by the Pythagorean theorem, we have \\[AB=\\sqrt{OA^2-OB^2}=\\sqrt{5^2-2^2}=\\sqrt{21}.\\]Thus, the height of the cylinder is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{21}}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes r_cylinder h_cylinder r_hemisphere :: real\nassumes h0 : \"r_cylinder = 2\"\nand h1 : \"r_hemisphere = 5\"\nand h2 : \"h_cylinder powr 2 + r_cylinder powr 2 = r_hemisphere powr 2\"\nshows  \"h_cylinder = sqrt 21\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "Given a cylinder with radius 2 and a hemisphere with radius 5, if the square of the cylinder's height plus the square of the cylinder's radius equals the square of the hemisphere's radius, what is the height of the cylinder? The height of the cylinder is the square root of 21."
