        "informal problem": "Given that the area of a circle with radius $r$ is defined as $\\frac{\\pi r^2}{2}$, and the areas of circles satisfy the properties that the difference in areas of two circles is the same as the area of a circle with radius equal to the difference of the two radii, and the sum of the areas of three circles is the same as the area of a circle with radius equal to the sum of the three radii. If the area of a circle with radius 1 is $\\frac{1}{2}$, what is the sum of the areas of three circles with radii $(1 - 1)$, $(1 - 1)$, and $1$ respectively? The answer should be $2$."
