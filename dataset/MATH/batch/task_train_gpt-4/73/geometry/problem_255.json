In any case, clearly $x = -48$ is extraneous, so we have that $x = 56.$ Therefore, we have $AC = 106$ and $BC = 56.$ (Did you know that $28:45:53$ is a Pythagorean triple?)\n Now, to find the area of $\\triangle ADC$ is straightforward. First, clearly the height to base $DC$ is $90,$ so we only really need to find $DC.$ Here we use the Angle Bisector Theorem: \\begin{align} \\frac{BD}{DC} &= \\frac{AB}{AC}\\\\\n \\frac{BD}{DC} &= \\frac{90}{106} = \\frac{45}{53}\\\\ 1 + \\frac{BD}{DC} &= 1 + \\frac{45}{53}\\\\ \\frac{BD + DC}{DC} = \\frac{BC}{DC} &= \\frac{98}{53}\\\\ \\frac{56}{DC} &= \\frac{98}{53}\\\\ DC &= \\frac{53}{98} \\cdot 56 = \\frac{212}{7}.\n \\end{align} Our area is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 90 \\cdot \\frac{212}{7} = 1362\\frac{6}{7} \\approx \\boxed{1363}.$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes x area_ADC :: real\nassumes h0 : \"AB = 90\"\nand h1 : \"BC = x\"\nand h2 : \"AC = 2 * x - 6\"\nand h3 : \"angle_ADC = angle_ADC\"\nand h4 : \"area_ADC = round (area_ADC)\"\nand h5 : \"area_ADC = (AB * x) / 2\"\nshows  \"area_ADC = 1363\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
