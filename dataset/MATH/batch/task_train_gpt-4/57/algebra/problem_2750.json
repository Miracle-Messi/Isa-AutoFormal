        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n Suppose the function $f$ has all real numbers in its domain and range and is invertible. Some values of $f$ are given by the following table: $$\\begin{array}{c || c | c | c | c | c}\nx & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\\n\\hline\nf(x) & 2 & 3 & 5 & 7 & 8\n\\end{array}$$What is the value of $f(f(3)) + f(f^{-1}(4)) + f^{-1}(f^{-1}(5))?$ If there is not enough information to answer this question, enter \"NEI\". The final Answer is 14\n ### Proof\n Reading the table, we see that $f(f(3)) = f(5) = 8.$ Although we can't look up $f^{-1}(4)$ in the table, we know that $f(f^{-1}(4)) = 4,$ since $f(f^{-1}(x))=x$ for all $x$ (by the definition of an inverse function).\n Since $f(3) = 5,$ we have $f^{-1}(5) = 3,$ and so $$f^{-1}(f^{-1}(5)) = f^{-1}(3).$$Then, since $f(2) = 3,$ we have $$f^{-1}(f^{-1}(5)) = f^{-1}(3) = 2.$$Combining the information above, we get $$f(f(3)) + f(f^{-1}(4)) + f^{-1}(f^{-1}(5)) = 8+4+2 = \\boxed{14}.$$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes f :: \"real \\<Rightarrow> real\" and f_inv :: \"real \\<Rightarrow> real\"\nassumes h0 : \"bij f\"\nand h1 : \"f 1 = 2\"\nand h2 : \"f 2 = 3\"\nand h3 : \"f 3 = 5\"\nand h4 : \"f 4 = 7\"\nand h5 : \"f 5 = 8\"\nand h6 : \"\\<forall> x. f_inv (f x) = x\"\nand h7 : \"\\<forall> x. f (f_inv x) = x\"\nshows  \"f (f 3) + f (f_inv 4) + f_inv (f_inv 5) = 14\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
