Find $MN$.\n The final Answer is 56\n ### Proof\n Extend ${CM}$ and ${CN}$ such that they intersect line ${AB}$ at points $P$ and $Q$, respectively. Since ${BM}$ is the angle bisector of angle $B$, and ${CM}$ is perpendicular to ${BM}$, so $BP=BC=120$, and $M$ is the midpoint of ${CP}$.\n For the same reason, $AQ=AC=117$, and $N$ is the midpoint of ${CQ}$.\n Hence $MN=\\frac{PQ}{2}$. $PQ=BP+AQ-AB=120+117-125=112$, so $MN=\\boxed{56}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes AB AC BC BK AL MN :: real\nand A B C L K M N :: point\nassumes h0 : \"AB = 125\"\nand h1 : \"AC = 117\"\nand h2 : \"BC = 120\"\nand h3 : \"is_angle_bisector B A C L\"\nand h4 : \"is_angle_bisector C B A K\"\nand h5 : \"M = foot C B K\"\nand h6 : \"N = foot C A L\"\nshows  \"MN = 56\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "In a triangle with sides AB = 125, AC = 117, and BC = 120, the angle bisectors of \u2220BAC and \u2220CBA meet at points L and K respectively. The perpendiculars from point C to lines BA and BC meet these lines at points M and N respectively. Find the distance between points M and N. The final answer is 56."
