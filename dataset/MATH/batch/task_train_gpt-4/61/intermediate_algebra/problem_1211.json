Moreover, since the given function has no horizontal asymptote, we know that the degree of $q(x)$ must be less than the degree of the numerator, which is $3$.\n Hence, $q(x)$ is a quadratic with roots $2$ and $-2$. In other words, we can write it as $q(x) = a(x+2)(x-2)$ for some constant $a$. Since $q(3) = 15$, we have $a(3+2)(3-2) = 15$.\n Solving for $a$ gives $a = 15/5 = 3$.\n Hence $q(x) = 3(x-2)(x+2) = \\boxed{3x^2 - 12}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes x q :: \"real \\<Rightarrow> real\"\nassumes h0 : \"q 3 = 15\"\nand h1 : \"\\<forall> x. x \\<noteq> 2 \\<and> x \\<noteq> -2 \\<longrightarrow> x powr 3 - 2 * x powr 2 - 5 * x + 3 / q x \\<noteq> \\<infinity>\"\nand h2 : \"\\<forall> x. x powr 3 - 2 * x powr 2 - 5 * x + 3 / q x \\<noteq> 0\"\nshows  \"\\<forall> x. q x = 3 * x powr 2 - 12\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
