Then $z = w - \\frac{1}{w}$ for some complex number $w$ with absolute value $3$.\n We can rewrite $z$ as $$z = w - \\frac{1}{w} = w - \\frac{\\overline{w}}{|w|^2}= w - \\frac{\\overline{w}}{9}.$$Let $w=x+iy$ where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers. Then we have $$z = x+iy - \\frac{x-iy}{9} =\\frac{8x + 10iy}{9}.$$This tells us that to go from $w$ to $z$ we need to stretch the real part by a factor of $\\frac{8}{9}$ and the imaginary part by a factor of $\\frac{10}{9}$.\n $T$ includes all complex numbers formed by stretching a complex number of absolute value $3$ in this way. Since all complex numbers of absolute value $3$ form a circle of radius $3$, $T$ is an ellipse formed by stretching a circle of radius $3$ by a factor of $\\frac{8}{9}$ in the $x$ direction and by a factor of $\\frac{10}{9}$ in the $y$ direction.\n Therefore, the area inside $T$ is $$\\frac{8}{9}\\cdot\\frac{10}{9}\\cdot9\\pi = \\boxed{\\frac{80}{9}\\pi}.$$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes z w :: complex and T :: \"complex set\"\nassumes h0 : \"T = {z. \\<exists>w. cmod w = 3 \\<and> z = w - inverse w}\"\nand h1 : \"closed_curve T\"\nshows  \"area T = 80 / 9 * pi\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "Let $T$ be the set of complex numbers $z$ such that there exists a complex number $w$ with modulus $3$ for which $z = w - \\frac{1}{w}$. If $T$ forms a closed curve, find the area enclosed by $T$. The final Answer is $\\frac{80}{9} \\pi$."
