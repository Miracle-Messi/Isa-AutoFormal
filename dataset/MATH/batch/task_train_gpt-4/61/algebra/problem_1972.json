If her total purchase price was $\\$$30.00, how many 30-cent items did she purchase? The final Answer is 20\n ### Proof\n Let $a,b,c$ be the number of 30 cent items, 2 dollar items, and 3 dollar items that Janice bought, respectively. Since there are 30 items in all, $a+b+c = 30$. The total cost is 3000 cents, so $30a+200b+300c = 3000$, which can be rewritten as \\begin{align}\n 30a+(30b+170b)+(30c+270c) &= 3000\\\\ \\Rightarrow 30(a+b+c) + 170b+270c &= 3000. \\end{align}  Substituting $a+b+c = 30$ gives \\begin{align} 30\\cdot30 + 170b+270c &=3000\\\\ \\Rightarrow 170b+270c &= 2100\\\\ \\Rightarrow 17b+27c &= 210.\n \\end{align} Thus, $17b+27c$ is a multiple of 10. Since $17b+27c = 10(b+2c) + 7(b+c)$, $7(b+c)$ is also a multiple of 10. 10 cannot divide 7, so 10 divides $b+c$. Janice bought 30 items, so the reasonable values of $b+c$ are $0, 10, 20, 30$.\n If $b+c = 0$, then $17b+27c = 0$, which isn't true. If $b+c=20$, then the least possible value of $17b+27c$ is $17\\cdot20 = 340$, which is also impossible.\n By the same reasoning $b+c=30$ is also impossible.\n We conclude that $b+c= 10$, namely that $b=6$ and $c=4$ to satisfy $17b+27c = 210$.\n Thus $a = 30-(b+c) = \\boxed{20}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes x y z :: nat\nassumes h0 : \"x + y + z = 30\"\nand h1 : \"30 * x + 200 * y + 300 * z = 3000\"\nshows  \"x = 20\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
