Each of Roark's unit cubes has volume $1$ cubic inch, so he needs $216$ cubes. Since each cube has $12$ edges, each of Roark's cubes has $12\\cdot1=12$ inches of wire.\n So his $216$ cubes have a total of $216\\cdot12$ inches of wire.\n So the desired fraction is $\\dfrac{72}{216\\cdot12}=\\dfrac{6}{216}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{36}}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes bonnie_wire roark_wire :: real\nassumes h0 : \"bonnie_wire = 12 * 6\"\nand h1 : \"roark_wire = bonnie_wire powr 3\"\nshows  \"bonnie_wire / roark_wire = 1 / 36\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "Bonnie has a wire that is 12 times longer than a 6 meter wire. Roark's wire is as long as Bonnie's wire cubed. What is the ratio of the length of Bonnie's wire to the length of Roark's wire? The final answer is $\\frac{1}{36}$."
