        "informal problem": "Consider a series $S_n$ where each term in the series is the sum of the reciprocals of the numbers from 1 to $10^n$, i.e., $S_n = \\sum_{i=1}^{10^n} \\frac{1}{i}$. If there exists a natural number $n$ for which $S_n$ is an integer, find the smallest such $n$ that is greater than 0. The final answer is 63."
