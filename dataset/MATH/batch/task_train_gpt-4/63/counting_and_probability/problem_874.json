This gives us a preliminary count of $5\\times5!=600$.\n However, no matter what the order of the last three letters, we will still get the same sequence of the first 4 letters; for example, LPROMEB, LPROEBM, and LPROBEM and three other permutations all have the first 4 letters LPRO.\n Because of this, each sequence of 4 letters has been counted exactly 6 times so our answer is $\\dfrac{5\\times5!}{6}=\\boxed{100}$. Alternative solution by stevenmeow: There are 5 ways to choose the last letter (B, R, O, M, or E) and the L must go first.\n That leaves 5 letters from which to choose the second and third letters, so we can choose the second and third letters in $5\\times 4 = 20$ ways. This gives us a total of $5\\times 20 = 100$ sequences of letters.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes n :: nat and L :: \"'a set\" and P :: \"'a set\"\nassumes h0 : \"finite L\"\nand h1 : \"card L = 7\"\nand h2 : \"finite P\"\nand h3 : \"card P = 1\"\nand h4 : \"P \\<subseteq> L\"\nand h5 : \"\\<forall> seq. seq \\<in> {seq. length seq = 4 \\<and> (\\<forall> i < 4. seq ! i \\<in> L) \\<and> distinct seq \\<and> seq ! 0 \\<in> {l. l \\<in> L \\<and> l \\<notin> P}} \\<longrightarrow> seq ! 3 \\<notin> P\"\nshows  \"card {seq. length seq = 4 \\<and> (\\<forall> i < 4. seq ! i \\<in> L) \\<and> distinct seq \\<and> seq ! 0 \\<in> {l. l \\<in> L \\<and> l \\<notin> P} \\<and> seq ! 3 \\<notin> P} = 100\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "In a set L of 7 distinct elements, there is a subset P with only 1 element. How many 4-element sequences can be formed from the elements of set L, such that the first element is not in P, the last element is not in P, and all elements in the sequence are distinct? The final answer is 100."
