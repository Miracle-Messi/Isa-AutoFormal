The final Answer is \\frac{16}{25}\n ### Proof\n Let $C_1$ and $C_2$ be the circumferences of the smaller and larger circle, respectively. The length of the $45^\\circ$ arc on the smaller circle is $\\left(\\frac{45^\\circ}{360^\\circ}\\right)C_1$, and the length of the $36^\\circ$ arc on the larger circle is $\\left(\\frac{36^\\circ}{360^\\circ}\\right)C_2$.\n Setting these two lengths equal we find \\[ \\frac{C_1}{C_2}=\\frac{36}{45}=\\frac{4}{5}. \\]The ratio of the areas of the two circles is the square of the ratio of their circumferences: \\[ \\frac{\\pi r_1^2}{\\pi r_2^2}=\\left(\\frac{r_1}{r_2}\\right)^2=\\left(\\frac{2\\pi r_1}{2\\pi r_2}\\right)^2=\\left(\\frac{C_1}{C_2}\\right)^2=\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^2=\\boxed{\\frac{16}{25}}.\n \\]\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes r1 r2 :: real\nassumes h0 : \"r1 < r2\"\nand h1 : \"r1 * (pi / 4) = r2 * (pi / 5)\"\nand h2 : \"r1 = sqrt (16 / 25) * r2\"\nshows  \"(pi * r1 powr 2) / (pi * r2 powr 2) = 16 / 25\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "Given that $r1$ is less than $r2$, and that $r1$ times the ratio of pi to 4 is equal to $r2$ times the ratio of pi to 5. Also, $r1$ is equal to the square root of the fraction 16/25 times $r2$. Find the ratio of the area of a circle with radius $r1$ to the area of a circle with radius $r2$. The final answer is 16/25."
