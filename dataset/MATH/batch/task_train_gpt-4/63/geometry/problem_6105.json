        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n The graph of the equation $9x+223y=2007$ is drawn on graph paper with each square representing one unit in each direction. How many of the $1$ by $1$ graph paper squares have interiors lying entirely below the graph and entirely in the first quadrant?\n The final Answer is 888\n ### Proof\n There are $223 \\cdot 9 = 2007$ squares in total formed by the rectangle with edges on the x and y axes and with vertices on the intercepts of the equation, since the intercepts of the lines are $(223,0),\\ (0,9)$.\n Count the number of squares that the diagonal of the rectangle passes through. Since the two diagonals of a rectangle are congruent, we can consider instead the diagonal $y = \\frac{223}{9}x$. This passes through 8 horizontal lines ($y = 1 \\ldots 8$) and 222 vertical lines ($x = 1 \\ldots 222$).\n At every time we cross a line, we enter a new square. Since 9 and 223 are relatively prime, we don\u2019t have to worry about crossing an intersection of a horizontal and vertical line at one time.\n We must also account for the first square. This means that it passes through $222 + 8 + 1 = 231$ squares. The number of non-diagonal squares is $2007 - 231 = 1776$.\n Divide this in 2 to get the number of squares in one of the triangles, with the answer being $\\frac{1776}2 = \\boxed{888}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes x y :: real\nassumes h0 : \"9 * x + 223 * y = 2007\"\nand h1 : \"x \\<ge> 0 \\<and> y \\<ge> 0\"\nshows  \"card { (x, y). x \\<in> {1..floor ((2007 - 9) / 223)}, y \\<in> {1..floor ((2007 - 9 * x) / 223)} } = 888\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "Given two non-negative real numbers $x$ and $y$ that satisfy $9x + 223y = 2007$, find the number of pairs $(x, y)$ such that $x$ is within the range from 1 to the floor value of $\\frac{2007 - 9}{223}$, and $y$ is within the range from 1 to the floor value of $\\frac{2007 - 9x}{223}$.
