The point enters a new cube in the $x$ dimension $150$ times, in the $y$ dimension $324$ times and in the $z$ dimension, $375$ times. The point enters a new cube in the $x$ and $y$ dimensions whenever a multiple of $\\frac{d}{150}$ equals a multiple of $\\frac{d}{324}$.\n This occurs $\\gcd(150, 324)$ times.\n Similarly, a point enters a new cube in the $y,z$ dimensions $\\gcd(324, 375)$ times and a point enters a new cube in the $z,x$ dimensions $\\gcd(375, 150)$ times. The point enters a new cube in the $x,y$ and $z$ dimensions whenever some multiples of $\\frac{d}{150}, \\frac{d}{324}, \\frac{d}{375}$ are equal.\n This occurs $\\gcd(150, 324, 375)$ times. The total number of unit cubes entered is then $150+324+375-[\\gcd(150, 324)+\\gcd(324, 375)+\\gcd(375, 150))] + \\gcd(150, 324, 375) = \\boxed{768}$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes a b c :: nat\nassumes h0 : \"a = 150\"\nand h1 : \"b = 324\"\nand h2 : \"c = 375\"\nshows  \"gcd (a, gcd (b, c)) + a + b + c - 3 = 768\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "Find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of three numbers: 150, 324, and 375. Add the gcd to the sum of the three numbers and then subtract 3. The final answer is 768."
