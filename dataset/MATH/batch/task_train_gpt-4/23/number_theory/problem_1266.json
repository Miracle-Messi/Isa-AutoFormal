The final Answer is 5\n ### Proof\n By definition of a base, it follows that $\\overline{ABC}_6 = 6^2 \\cdot A + 6 \\cdot B + C$. Noting that every digit appears in every possible slot once, it follows that $\\overline{ABC}_6 + \\overline{BCA}_6+ \\overline{CAB}_6 = (6^2 + 6 + 1)(A + B + C).$ The value is equal to the sum, $\\overline{AAA0}_6 = 6^3 \\cdot A + 6^2 \\cdot A + 6 \\cdot A = (6^2 + 6 + 1) \\cdot (6 \\cdot A)$.\n Setting them equal, $$(6^2 + 6 + 1)(A + B + C) = (6^2 + 6 + 1) \\cdot (6 \\cdot A) \\Longrightarrow B+C = 5 \\cdot A.$$Since $B,C < 6$, then $B+C < 2 \\cdot 6$, so $A = 1,2$.\n However, there do not exist distinct base $6$ digits such that $B + C = 2 \\cdot 5$, so it follows that $A = 1_6$, and $B+C = \\boxed{5}_6$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes A B C :: nat\nassumes h0 : \"A \\<noteq> 0\"\nand h1 : \"B \\<noteq> 0\"\nand h2 : \"C \\<noteq> 0\"\nand h3 : \"A \\<noteq> B\"\nand h4 : \"A \\<noteq> C\"\nand h5 : \"B \\<noteq> C\"\nand h6 : \"A \\<le> 5\"\nand h7 : \"B \\<le> 5\"\nand h8 : \"C \\<le> 5\"\nand h9 : \"6 * 6 * A + 6 * B + C + 6 * 6 * B + 6 * C + A + 6 * 6 * C + 6 * A + B = 6 * 6 * 6 * A\"\nshows  \"B + C = 5\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
