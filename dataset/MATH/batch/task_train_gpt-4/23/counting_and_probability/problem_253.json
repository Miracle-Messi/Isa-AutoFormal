If I roll both dice, what is the probability they come up the same? The final Answer is \\dfrac{13}{40}\n ### Proof\n This problem requires a little bit of casework. There are four ways in which the dice can both show the same thing: if they both show maroon, both show teal, both show cyan or both show sparkly. The probability of getting maroon is $\\dfrac{4}{20}$, so the probability that they will both show maroon is $\\left(\\dfrac{4}{20}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{16}{400}$.\n Similarly, the probability of getting teal is $\\dfrac{7}{20}$, so the probability that they will both show teal is $\\left(\\dfrac{7}{20}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{49}{400}$, the probability of getting cyan is $\\dfrac{8}{20}$, so the probability that they will both show cyan is $\\left(\\dfrac{8}{20}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{64}{400}$ and the probability of getting sparkly is $\\dfrac{1}{20}$, so the probability that they will both get sparkly is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{20}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{1}{400}$.\n So our answer is $\\dfrac{16}{400}+\\dfrac{49}{400}+\\dfrac{64}{400}+\\dfrac{1}{400}=\\frac{130}{400}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{40}}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes maroon teal cyan sparkly :: real\nassumes h0 : \"maroon = 4 / 20\"\nand h1 : \"teal = 7 / 20\"\nand h2 : \"cyan = 8 / 20\"\nand h3 : \"sparkly = 1 / 20\"\nshows  \"maroon * maroon + teal * teal + cyan * cyan + sparkly * sparkly = 13 / 40\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "Given that maroon = $\\frac{4}{20}$, teal = $\\frac{7}{20}$, cyan = $\\frac{8}{20}$, and sparkly = $\\frac{1}{20}$, find the sum of the squares of these values. The final answer is $\\frac{13}{40}$."
