From this, John was able to determine the number of problems Mary solved correctly. If Mary's score had been any lower, but still over $80$, John could not have determined this. What was Mary's score? (Recall that the AHSME consists of $30$ multiple choice problems and that one's score, $s$, is computed by the formula $s=30+4c-w$, where $c$ is the number of correct answers and $w$ is the number of wrong answers.

        "informal problem": "In a certain game, the combined score of cats and wolves cannot exceed 30. The score of the snakes is calculated as 30 plus four times the number of cats minus the number of wolves. If the score of the snakes is more than 80 and for any score less than the snakes' score and more than 80, there exists a different combination of cats and wolves scores that would yield that score, what is the maximum possible score for the snakes?
