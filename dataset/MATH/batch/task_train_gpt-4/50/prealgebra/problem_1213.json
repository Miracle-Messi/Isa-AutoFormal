        "informal problem": "The total income of a population is composed of three income groups. The first group earns below 10k and makes up 25% of the total income. The second group earns between 10k and 100k and makes up 59% of the total income. The third group earns above 100k and makes up 16% of the total income. What is the combined percentage of the total income made up by the first and second groups? The final answer is 84%."
