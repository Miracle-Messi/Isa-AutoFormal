Looking at angle $EDF$, we can see that $m\\angle EDF=180^\\circ-m\\angle BDA-m\\angle BDE=180^\\circ-108^\\circ-36^\\circ=36^\\circ$.\n We also know that $EF$ is parallel to $BD$, and so the alternate interior angles $\\angle BDE$ and $\\angle FED$ are congruent.\n Thus, $m\\angle FED=36^\\circ$ and triangle $DEF$ is isosceles.\n We have nearly found them all.\n We can compute that $\\angle EFD=180^\\circ-36^\\circ-36^\\circ=108^\\circ$, and so $\\angle EFC=180^\\circ-108^\\circ=72^\\circ$ degrees.\n From the very beginning, we know that $m\\angle ACB =72^\\circ$, so $\\triangle FEC$ is isosceles. This makes $m\\angle FEC=180^\\circ-72^\\circ-72^\\circ=36^\\circ$ degrees, and so $m\\angle DEC=36^\\circ+36^\\circ=72^\\circ$.\n So, our final isosceles triangle is $DEC$.\n We have found a total of $\\boxed{7}$ isosceles triangles.\n *)\n\nThis problem is a geometric problem involving visual interpretation and counting, which cannot be directly translated into Isabelle's language as it involves visual elements and does not have a mathematical formula or theorem to be proved. Isabelle is a proof assistant used to formalize mathematical proofs and it deals with abstract mathematical structures, but it does not have capabilities to handle geometric drawings or count elements in a figure.\n\nHowever, if we had a predicate `isosceles` such that `isosceles A B C` would mean triangle ABC is isosceles, and a predicate `in_figure` such that `in_figure A` would mean point A is in the figure, we could write something like this:\n\n```\ntheorem\nassumes h0 : \"\\<forall> A B C. in_figure A \\<and> in_figure B \\<and> in_figure C \\<longrightarrow> isosceles A B C\"\nshows  \"card {T. \\<exists> A B C. T = {A, B, C} \\<and> isosceles A B C} = 7\"\n```\n\nThis would mean \"assuming that all triangles with vertices in the figure are isosceles, there are 7 such triangles\". But this is a very high-level and abstract representation of the problem that doesn't capture all its details.\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
