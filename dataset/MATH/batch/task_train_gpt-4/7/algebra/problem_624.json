The final Answer is (2,8)\n ### Proof\n Since the quadratic has only one solution, the discriminant must be equal to zero. The discriminant is $b^2-4ac=64-4ac=0$, so $ac=\\frac{64}{4}=16$.\n We need to find $a$ and $c$ given $a+c=10$ and $ac=16$.\n We could write a quadratic equation and solve, but instead we rely on clever algebraic manipulations: Since $a+c=10$, we have $$(a+c)^2=a^2+c^2+2ac=10^2=100.$$We subtract $4ac=64$ from each side to find $$a^2+c^2+2ac-4ac=a^2+c^2-2ac=100-64=36.$$We recognize each side as a square, so we take the square root of both sides: $$\\sqrt{a^2+c^2-2ac}=\\sqrt{(c-a)^2}=c-a=\\sqrt{36}=6.$$(Technically we should take the positive and negative square root of both sides, but since $c>a$ we know $c-a>0$.)\n Thus we have  \\begin{align} c-a&=6\\\\ c+a&=10 \\end{align}Summing these equations gives \\begin{align} 2c&=16\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad c&=8, \\end{align}and $a=10-c=2$.\n Thus our ordered pair $(a,c)$ is $\\boxed{(2,8)}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes a c :: real\nassumes h0 : \"a * x^2 + 8 * x + c = 0\"\nand h1 : \"a + c = 10\"\nand h2 : \"a < c\"\nand h3 : \"\\<forall> x. a * x^2 + 8 * x + c = 0 \\<longrightarrow> x = - (8 / (2 * a))\"\nshows  \"a = 2 \\<and> c = 8\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
