        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n Two integers are relatively prime if they have no common factors other than 1 or -1. What is the probability that a positive integer less than or equal to 30 is relatively prime to 30? Express your answer as a common fraction. The final Answer is \\frac{4}{15}\n ### Proof\n It might be easier to find the integers less than or equal to 30 which are NOT relatively prime to 30. They include 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, $\\ldots$, 28, 30, or 15 even integers. They also include 3, 9, 15, 21, 27, or the odd multiples of 3.\n And also, 5, 25, the multiples of 5 relatively prime to 2 and 3.\n So we have a total of $15+5+2 = 22$ numbers sharing a factor with 30.\n So there are 8 relatively prime integers, giving us a ratio of $\\frac{8}{30} = \\boxed{\\frac{4}{15}}$. Notice that the prime divisors of 30 are 2, 3, and 5, and we have $$30\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{1}{5}\\right) = 30 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{4}{5} = 8,$$ which equals the number of positive integers less than 30 that are relatively prime to 30.\n Is this a coincidence?\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes gcd :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> nat \\<Rightarrow> nat\" and relatively_prime :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> nat \\<Rightarrow> bool\"\nassumes h0 : \"\\<forall> a b. gcd a b = (GREATEST d. d dvd a \\<and> d dvd b)\"\nand h1 : \"\\<forall> a b. relatively_prime a b = (gcd a b = 1)\"\nand h2 : \"count {k. k \\<in> {1..30} \\<and> relatively_prime k 30} = 8\"\nshows  \"8 / 30 = 4 / 15\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
