What is the criterion for this statement to be true?\n We consider the locus of midpoints of the chords from $A$. It is well-known that this is the circle with diameter $AO$, where $O$ is the center of the circle. The proof is simple: every midpoint of a chord is a dilation of the endpoint with scale factor $\\frac{1}{2}$ and center $A$.\n Thus, the locus is the result of the dilation with scale factor $\\frac{1}{2}$ and centre $A$ of circle $O$.\n Let the center of this circle be $P$.\n Now, $AD$ is bisected by $BC$ if they cross at some point $N$ on the circle.

Then it remains to find $AR$ so that we can use the addition formula for $\\sin$. As $PN$ is a radius of circle $P$, $PN=2.5$, and similarly, $PO=2.5$.\n Since $OM=4$, we have $OQ=OM-QM=OM-PN=4-2.5=1.5$.\n Thus $PQ=\\sqrt{2.5^2-1.5^2}=2$. Further, we see that $\\triangle OAR$ is a dilation of $\\triangle OPQ$ about center $O$ with scale factor $2$, so $AR=2PQ=4$.
