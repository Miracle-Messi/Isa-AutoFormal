        "informal problem": "Consider a quadrilateral with vertices A, B, C, D in the plane. The distances between the vertices are as follows: AB = 92, BC = 50, CD = 19, and DA = 70. The lines AB and CD are parallel. There is a point P on the segment AB. There is a circle centered at P which is tangent to the line BC at the point where the distance from P to C is the radius of the circle. Similarly, there is a circle centered at P which is tangent to the line DA at the point where the distance from P to D is the radius of the circle. The distance from A to P is a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime. What is the sum of m and n? The final answer is 164."
