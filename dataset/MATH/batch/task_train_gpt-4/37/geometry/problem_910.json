Express your answer in simplest radical form. The final Answer is \\sqrt 2+\\sqrt 5\n ### Proof\n Triangles $\\triangle ABC$ and $\\triangle ADC$ are both right and share hypotenuse $AC$, which has length $3$.\n Thus we have $$AB^2+BC^2 = AD^2+DC^2 = 3^2 = 9.$$The only possible integer values for $AB,$ $BC,$ $AD,$ or $DC$ are $1$ and $2$.\n Thus we may assume that one leg of $\\triangle ABC$ has length $1$ and one leg of $\\triangle ADC$ has length $2$ (it doesn't matter if the labels $B$ and $D$ have to be swapped to make this true). If one leg of $\\triangle ABC$ has length $1,$ then the other leg has length $\\sqrt{3^2-1^2} = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$.\n If one leg of $\\triangle ADC$ has length $2,$ then the other leg has length $\\sqrt{3^2-2^2}= \\sqrt{5}$.\n Thus, quadrilateral $ABCD$ is divided by its diagonal $AC$ into right triangles of area $\\frac{1\\cdot2\\sqrt 2}{2}=\\sqrt 2$ and $\\frac{2\\cdot\\sqrt 5}{2}=\\sqrt 5$.\n So, the area of quadrilateral $ABCD$ is $\\boxed{\\sqrt 2+\\sqrt 5}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes A B C D :: \"real * real\"\nand AB :: real and BC :: real and CD :: real and DA :: real\nand AC :: real\nassumes h0 : \"AC = 3\"\nand h1 : \"AB = BC\"\nand h2 : \"CD = DA\"\nand h3 : \"AB \\<noteq> CD\"\nand h4 : \"AB \\<in> \\<int>\"\nand h5 : \"CD \\<in> \\<int>\"\nand h6 : \"angle B = 90\"\nand h7 : \"angle D = 90\"\nshows  \"area ABCD = sqrt 2 + sqrt 5\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "In a quadrilateral ABCD, the lengths AB and BC are equal, and the lengths CD and DA are also equal. The lengths AB and CD are integers, but they are not equal. The diagonal AC has length 3. Angles B and D are right angles. Find the area of the quadrilateral ABCD. The final answer is $\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{5}$."
