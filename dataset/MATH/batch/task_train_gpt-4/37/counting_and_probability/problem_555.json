A marble is drawn at random from Bag A.  If it is white, a marble is drawn at random from Bag B, otherwise, if it is black, a marble is drawn at random from Bag C.  What is the probability that the second marble drawn is yellow? The final Answer is \\frac{103}{245}\n ### Proof\n We can get the second marble to be yellow in two ways:  either a white from A (with probability 3/7) then a yellow from B (with probability 6/10), or a black from A (with probability 4/7) then a yellow from C (with probability 2/7).\n Thus, the probability is \\[ \\left(\\frac{3}{7}\\times\\frac{6}{10}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{4}{7}\\times\\frac{2}{7}\\right)=\\boxed{\\frac{103}{245}}.\\]\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes P_A_w P_A_b P_B_y P_B_b P_C_y P_C_b :: real\nassumes h0 : \"P_A_w = 3 / 7\"\nand h1 : \"P_A_b = 4 / 7\"\nand h2 : \"P_B_y = 6 / 10\"\nand h3 : \"P_B_b = 4 / 10\"\nand h4 : \"P_C_y = 2 / 7\"\nand h5 : \"P_C_b = 5 / 7\"\nshows  \"P_A_w * P_B_y + P_A_b * P_C_y = 103 / 245\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "In a certain game, the probabilities of different outcomes are as follows:\n\n- Probability of Player A winning is $\\frac{3}{7}$, and losing is $\\frac{4}{7}$.\n- Probability of Player B winning with yellow is $\\frac{6}{10}$, and with blue is $\\frac{4}{10}$.\n- Probability of Player C winning with yellow is $\\frac{2}{7}$, and with blue is $\\frac{5}{7}$.\n\nFind the probability of the combined event that Player A wins with Player B winning with yellow, or Player A loses with Player C winning with yellow. The final answer is $\\frac{103}{245}$."
