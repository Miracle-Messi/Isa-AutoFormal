        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n Determine the tens digit of $17^{1993}$. The final Answer is 3\n ### Proof\n To find the tens digit of $17^{1993}$, we can look at the first few power of 17 modulo 100: \\begin{align} 17^0 &\\equiv 1, \\\\ 17^1 &\\equiv 17, \\\\ 17^2 &\\equiv 17 \\cdot 17 \\equiv 289 \\equiv 89, \\\\ 17^3 &\\equiv 17 \\cdot 89 \\equiv 1513 \\equiv 13, \\\\\n 17^4 &\\equiv 17 \\cdot 13 \\equiv 221 \\equiv 21 \\pmod{100}. \\end{align}\n We know that if we find a power of 17 whose last two digits are 01, then the last two digits in the power of 17 become periodic at that point.\n We don't have that in $17^4$, but the units digit in $17^4$ is 1.\n We have matched the units digit, so let's use powers of $17^4$: \\begin{align} 17^4 &\\equiv 21, \\\\ 17^8 &\\equiv 21 \\cdot 21 \\equiv 441 \\equiv 41, \\\\ 17^{12} &\\equiv 21 \\cdot 41 \\equiv 861 \\equiv 61, \\\\ 17^{16} &\\equiv 21 \\cdot 61 \\equiv 1281 \\equiv 81, \\\\\n 17^{20} &\\equiv 21 \\cdot 81 \\equiv 1701 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{100}. \\end{align} We found a power of 17 whose last two digits are 01, so the last two digits are periodic, with period 20. Since $1993 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{20}$, \\[17^{1993} \\equiv 17^{13} \\pmod{100}.\\] Then \\begin{align}\n 17^{13} &\\equiv 17^{12} \\cdot 17 \\\\ &\\equiv 61 \\cdot 17 \\\\ &\\equiv 1037 \\\\ &\\equiv 37 \\pmod{100}. \\end{align} Therefore, the tens digit of $17^{1993}$ is $\\boxed{3}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes a b :: nat\nassumes h0 : \"b = 10\"\nand h1 : \"a = (17^1993) mod (b^2)\"\nshows  \"a div b = 3\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
