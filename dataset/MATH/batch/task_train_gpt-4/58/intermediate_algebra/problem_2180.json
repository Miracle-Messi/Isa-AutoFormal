The final Answer is x^3-10x^2+37x-52\n ### Proof\n Solution #1 Since $p(x)$ has real coefficients and has $3-2i$ as a root, it also has the complex conjugate, $3+2i$, as a root. The quadratic that has $3-2i$ and $3+2i$ as roots is \\begin{align} \\left(x-(3-2i)\\right)\\left(x-(3+2i)\\right) &= (x-3+2i)(x-3-2i) \\\\\n &= (x-3)^2 - (2i)^2 \\\\ &= x^2-6x+9+4 \\\\ &= x^2-6x+13. \\end{align}By the Factor Theorem, we know that $x^2-6x+13$ divides $p(x)$. Since $p(x)$ is cubic, it has one more root $r$.\n We can now write $p(x)$ in the form $$p(x) = a(x^2-6x+13)(x-r).$$Moreover, $a=1$, because we are given that $p(x)$ is monic.\n Substituting $x=0$, we have $p(0)=-13r$, but we also know that $p(0)=-52$; therefore, $r=4$.\n Hence we have \\begin{align} p(x) &= (x^2-6x+13)(x-4) \\\\ &= \\boxed{x^3-10x^2+37x-52}. \\end{align}Solution #2 (essentially the same as #1, but written in terms of using Vieta's formulas) Since $p(x)$ has real coefficients and has $3-2i$ as a root, it also has the complex conjugate, $3+2i$, as a root.\n The sum and product of these two roots, respectively, are $6$ and $3^2-(2i)^2=13$.\n Thus, the monic quadratic that has these two roots is $x^2-6x+13$.\n By the Factor Theorem, we know that $x^2-6x+13$ divides $p(x)$. Since $p(x)$ is cubic, it has one more root $r$. Because $p(0)$ equals the constant term, and because $p(x)$ is monic, Vieta's formulas tell us that $(3-2i)(3+2i)r = (-1)^3(-52) = 52$.\n Thus $r=4$, and \\begin{align} p(x) &= (x^2-6x+13)(x-4) \\\\ &= \\boxed{x^3-10x^2+37x-52}. \\end{align}\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes x :: complex and p :: \"complex \\<Rightarrow> complex\"\nassumes h0 : \"p = (\\<lambda>x. x powr 3 - 10 * x powr 2 + 37 * x - 52)\"\nand h1 : \"p (3 - 2 * \\<i>) = 0\"\nand h2 : \"p 0 = -52\"\nshows  \"\\<forall>x. p x = x powr 3 - 10 * x powr 2 + 37 * x - 52\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
