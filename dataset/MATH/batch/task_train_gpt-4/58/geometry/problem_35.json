Furthermore, if the radius of the base of the cone is $r$, then the side length of the square is $2r$.\n Let $h$ be the common height of the cone and the prism. Then the volume of the cone is \\[\\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h,\\] and the volume of the prism is $(2r)^2 h = 4r^2 h$, so the desired ratio is \\[\\frac{\\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h}{4r^2 h} = \\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{12}}.\\]\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes r h :: real\nassumes h0 : \"r > 0\"\nand h1 : \"h > 0\"\nshows  \"(1/3) * pi * (r powr 2) * h / (r powr 2) * h = pi / 12\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
