        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n What is the product of all the coordinates of all the points of intersection of the two circles defined by $x^2-2x +y^2-10y+25=0$ and $x^2-8x+y^2-10y+37=0$? The final Answer is 10\n ### Proof\n Add $(-2/2)^2$ and $(-10/2)^2$ to the first equation and $(-8/2)^2$ and $(-10/2)^2$ to the second equation to find that the given equations are equivalent to \\begin{align} (x^2-2x+1)+(y^2-10y+25)&=1\\text{, and} \\\\\n (x^2-8x+16)+(y^2-10y+25)&=4 \\end{align} which are equivalent to \\begin{align} (x-1)^2+(y-5)^2 &=1^2, \\\\ (x-4)^2+(y-5)^2 &=2^2, \\end{align} respectively.\n Hence, the two circles have centers $(1,5)$ and $(4,5)$ respectively and radii $1$ and $2$ respectively.
