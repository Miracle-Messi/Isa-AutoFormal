First we note that $a$ must be $7$ or $-7$, since the coefficient of $x^2$ in $(ax+b)^2$ is $a^2$, and we need this to equal $49$.\n Since we are given that $a>0$, we reject $-7$ and select $a=7$.\n Now we want $49x^2+56x-64$ to have the same coefficient of $x$ as $(7x+b)^2$. Since the coefficient of $x$ in $(7x+b)^2$ is $14b$, we solve $56 = 14b$ to obtain $b=4$.\n Therefore, $49x^2+56x-64$ agrees with $(7x+4)^2$, except that the constant term is different. Specifically, $(7x+4)^2 = 49x^2+56x+16$.\n Now we can rewrite Po's original equation as follows: \\begin{align} 49x^2+56x-64 &= 0\\\\ 49x^2+56x+16 &= 80\\\\ (7x+4)^2 &= 80. \\end{align}This gives $a + b + c = 7 + 4 + 80 = \\boxed{91}.$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes x a b c :: int\nassumes h0 : \"\\<forall> x. 49 * x^2 + 56 * x - 64 = 0\"\nand h1 : \"\\<forall> x.

        "informal problem": "A quadratic equation is given by $49x^2 + 56x - 64 = 0$. There exists another quadratic equation in the form of $(ax + b)^2 = c$, where $a > 0$. Find the sum of $a$, $b$, and $c$. The final answer is 91."
