If $TA = TB = 10$ and $TC = 9$, then what is the volume of pyramid $TABC$? The final Answer is 150\n ### Proof\n [asy] import three; triple A = (4,8,0); triple B= (4,0,0); triple C = (0,0,0); triple D = (0,8,0); triple P = (4,8,6); draw(B--P--D--A--B); draw(A--P); draw(B--D,dashed); label(\"$T$\",A,S); label(\"$B$\",B,W);\n label(\"$C$\",D,E); label(\"$A$\",P,N); [/asy]\n We can think of $TAB$ as the base of the pyramid, and $\\overline{CT}$ as the height from apex $C$ to the base, since $\\overline{CT}$ is perpendicular to face $ABT$. The area of right triangle $ABT$ is $(10)(10)/2 = 50$ square units, so the volume of the pyramid is $\\frac13([ABT])(CT) = \\frac13(50)(9) = \\boxed{150}$ cubic units.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes TA TB TC :: real\nassumes h0 : \"TA = TB = 10\"\nand h1 : \"TC = 9\"\nand h2 : \"TA \\<noteq> 0\"\nand h3 : \"TB \\<noteq> 0\"\nand h4 : \"TC \\<noteq> 0\"\nand h5 : \"TA \\<perp> TB\"\nand h6 : \"TB \\<perp> TC\"\nand h7 : \"TA \\<perp> TC\"\nshows  \"volume(TABC) = 150\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
