        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n How many three-digit numbers are multiples of neither 5 nor 7? The final Answer is 618\n ### Proof\n It's easy to count the number of three-digit numbers which are multiples of 5 or 7: the smallest multiple of 7 which is a three-digit number is $15 \\times 7 = 105$, and the largest multiple of 7 that is a three-digit number is $142 \\times 7 = 994$.\n Therefore, there are $142-15+1 = 128$ three-digit numbers that are multiples of 7. The smallest multiple of 5 that is a three-digit number is $20\\times 5 = 100$, and the largest multiple of 5 that is a three digit number is $199\\times 5 =995$.\n So there are $199-20+1=180$ multiples of 5.\n Now notice that we have counted some numbers twice: those multiples of $5\\times7=35$. The smallest multiple of 35 is $3\\times 35 = 105$, the largest multiple of 35 is $28\\times35 =980$.\n So there are $28-3+1=26$ multiples of 35.\n We have 128 multiples of 7 and 180 multiples of 5, but we count 26 multiples twice.\n So, there are a total of $128+180-26 = 282$ distinct three-digit numbers that are multiples of 5 or 7 (or both). There are 900 three-digit numbers in total (from 100 to 999), so there are $900-282=\\boxed{618}$ three-digit numbers that are not multiples of 7 nor 5.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes count_multiples :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> nat \\<Rightarrow> nat\" and count_neither_multiples :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> nat \\<Rightarrow> nat\"\nassumes h0 : \"\\<forall>m n. count_multiples m n = n div m\"\nand h1 : \"\\<forall>m n k. count_neither_multiples m n k = k - count_multiples m k - count_multiples n k + count_multiples (lcm m n) k\"\nshows  \"count_neither_multiples 5 7 999 - count_neither_multiples 5 7 99 = 618\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
