The final Answer is \\text{A,B,C,D}\n ### Proof\n We divide each number in the sum by $32$ to get the following equalities:   \\begin{align} 64 &= 32 \\cdot 2\\\\ 96 &= 32 \\cdot 3\\\\ 128 &= 32 \\cdot 4\\\\ 160 &= 32 \\cdot 5\\\\ 288 &= 32 \\cdot 9\\\\ 352 &= 32 \\cdot 11\\\\\n 3232 &= 32 \\cdot 101. \\end{align} These equations tell us that each of the numbers in the sum is a multiple of $32$. A sum of multiples of $32$ is a multiple of $32$, so $x$ is a multiple of $32$. It follows that D is true.\n Recall that, for integers $x$, $y$, and $z$, if $x$ is a factor of $y$ and $y$ is a factor of $z$, then $x$ is a factor of $z$. Note that      $$32 = 4 \\cdot 8 = 16 \\cdot 2,$$ so $4$, $8$, and $16$ are factors of $32$.\n We already showed $32$ is a factor of $x$, so $4$, $8$, and $16$ must also be factors of $x$.
