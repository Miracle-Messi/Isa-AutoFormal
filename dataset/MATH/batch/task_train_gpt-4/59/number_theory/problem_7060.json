        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n Let $N$ be the number of consecutive $0$'s at the right end of the decimal representation of the product $1!2!3!4!\\cdots99!100!.$ Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$.\n The final Answer is 124\n ### Proof\n A number in decimal notation ends in a zero for each power of ten which divides it.\n Thus, we need to count both the number of 5s and the number of 2s dividing into our given expression. Since there are clearly more 2s than 5s, it is sufficient to count the number of 5s. One way to do this is as follows: $96$ of the numbers $1!,\\ 2!,\\ 3!,\\ 100!$ have a factor of $5$.\n $91$ have a factor of $10$. $86$ have a factor of $15$. And so on. This gives us an initial count of $96 + 91 + 86 + \\ldots + 1$. Summing this arithmetic series of $20$ terms, we get $970$.\n However, we have neglected some powers of $5$ - every $n!$ term for $n\\geq25$ has an additional power of $5$ dividing it, for $76$ extra; every n! for $n\\geq 50$ has one more in addition to that, for a total of $51$ extra; and similarly there are $26$ extra from those larger than $75$ and $1$ extra from $100$.\n Thus, our final total is $970 + 76 + 51 + 26 + 1 = 1124$, and the answer is $\\boxed{124}$.\n *)\n\nUnfortunately, the given problem cannot be translated directly into the Isabelle language since it involves concepts such as factorials and remainders which are not directly supported in the language. However, the problem can be modelled in a pseudo-code like format which can then be translated into the Isabelle language.\n\nPseudo code:\nLet N be the number of trailing zeros in the product of the factorials of numbers from 1 to 100.\nFind the remainder of N when divided by 1000.\n\nIsabelle language version:\nThis cannot be translated directly to Isabelle/HOL. The problem involves concepts of counting trailing zeros in a factorial product, which is not a built-in concept in Isabelle/HOL. One would have to define these concepts first, which is non-trivial.\n\nHowever, here's a sketch of how it could look:\n\n```\ndefinition count_trailing_zeros :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> nat\"\nwhere \"count_trailing_zeros n = (SOME k. n = 10^k * (n div 10^k))\"\n\ndefinition factorial_product :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> nat\"\nwhere \"factorial_product n = (if n = 0 then 1 else n * factorial_product (n - 1))\"\n\nlemma count_zeros_in_factorial_product:\n  fixes n :: nat\n  assumes h0 : \"n = 100\"\nshows  \"count_trailing_zeros (factorial_product n) mod 1000 = 124\"\n```\n\nThis sketch assumes that the functions `count_trailing_zeros` and `factorial_product` are defined appropriately. The `count_trailing_zeros` function counts the number of trailing zeros in its argument, and the `factorial_product` function computes the product of the factorials of all numbers up to its argument.
