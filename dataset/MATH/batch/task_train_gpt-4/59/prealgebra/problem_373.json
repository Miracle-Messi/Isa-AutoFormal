        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n There are 30 people in my math class.  12 of them have cool dads, 15 of them have cool moms, and 9 of them have cool dads and cool moms.  How many people have moms and dads who are both uncool? The final Answer is 12\n ### Proof\n We can solve this with a Venn diagram. First we notice that there are 9 people with both cool dads and cool moms. [asy] label(\"Cool Dad\", (2,75)); label(\"Cool Mom\", (80,75)); draw(Circle((30,45), 22));\n draw(Circle((58, 45), 22)); label(scale(0.8)*\"$9$\", (44, 45)); //label(scale(0.8)*\"$33$\",(28,45)); //label(scale(0.8)*\"$23$\",(63,45)); //label(scale(0.8)*\"$17$\", (70, 15)); [/asy] Since 12 people have cool dads and 9 of those have cool moms, too, $12-9=3$ of the people have cool dads and uncool moms.\n Likewise, $15-9=6$ people have cool moms and uncool dads. [asy] label(\"Cool Dad\", (2,75)); label(\"Cool Mom\", (80,75)); draw(Circle((30,45), 22)); draw(Circle((58, 45), 22)); label(scale(0.8)*\"$9$\", (44, 45));\n label(scale(0.8)*\"$3$\",(28,45)); label(scale(0.8)*\"$6$\",(63,45)); //label(scale(0.8)*\"$17$\", (70, 15)); [/asy] This means that $3+9+6=18$ people have at least one cool parent. That leaves $30-18=\\boxed{12}$ sad people with a pair of uncool parents.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes total cool_dads cool_moms both_cool :: nat\nassumes h0 : \"total = 30\"\nand h1 : \"cool_dads = 12\"\nand h2 : \"cool_moms = 15\"\nand h3 : \"both_cool = 9\"\nshows  \"total - (cool_dads + cool_moms - both_cool) = 12\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
