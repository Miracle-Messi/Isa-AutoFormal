        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n In right $\\triangle ABC$ with hypotenuse $\\overline{AB}$, $AC = 12$, $BC = 35$, and $\\overline{CD}$ is the altitude to $\\overline{AB}$. Let $\\omega$ be the circle having $\\overline{CD}$ as a diameter. Let $I$ be a point outside $\\triangle ABC$ such that $\\overline{AI}$ and $\\overline{BI}$ are both tangent to circle $\\omega$. The ratio of the perimeter of $\\triangle ABI$ to the length $AB$ can be expressed in the form $\\frac {m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$.\n The final Answer is 11\n ### Proof\n Let $O$ be center of the circle and $P$,$Q$ be the two points of tangent such that $P$ is on $BI$ and $Q$ is on $AI$.\n We know that $AD:CD = CD:BD = 12:35$. Since the ratios between corresponding lengths of two similar diagrams are equal, we can let $AD = 144, CD = 420$ and $BD = 1225$.\n Hence $AQ = 144, BP = 1225, AB = 1369$ and the radius $r = OD = 210$. Since we have $\\tan OAB = \\frac {35}{24}$ and $\\tan OBA = \\frac{6}{35}$ , we have $\\sin {(OAB + OBA)} = \\frac {1369}{\\sqrt {(1801*1261)}},$$\\cos {(OAB + OBA)} = \\frac {630}{\\sqrt {(1801*1261)}}$.\n Hence $\\sin I = \\sin {(2OAB + 2OBA)} = \\frac {2*1369*630}{1801*1261}$. let $IP = IQ = x$ , then we have Area$(IBC)$ = $(2x + 1225*2 + 144*2)*\\frac {210}{2}$ = $(x + 144)(x + 1225)* \\sin {\\frac {I}{2}}$.\n Then we get $x + 1369 = \\frac {3*1369*(x + 144)(x + 1225)}{1801*1261}$.\n Now the equation looks very complex but we can take a guess here. Assume that $x$ is a rational number (If it's not then the answer to the problem would be irrational which can't be in the form of $\\frac {m}{n}$) that can be expressed as $\\frac {a}{b}$ such that $(a,b) = 1$.\n Look at both sides; we can know that $a$ has to be a multiple of $1369$ and not of $3$ and it's reasonable to think that $b$ is divisible by $3$ so that we can cancel out the $3$ on the right side of the equation.\n Let's see if $x = \\frac {1369}{3}$ fits. Since $\\frac {1369}{3} + 1369 = \\frac {4*1369}{3}$, and $\\frac {3*1369*(x + 144)(x + 1225)}{1801*1261} = \\frac {3*1369* \\frac {1801}{3} * \\frac {1261*4}{3}} {1801*1261} = \\frac {4*1369}{3}$.\n Amazingly it fits! Since we know that $3*1369*144*1225 - 1369*1801*1261 < 0$, the other solution of this equation is negative which can be ignored.\n Hence $x = 1369/3$.\n Hence the perimeter is $1225*2 + 144*2 + \\frac {1369}{3} *2 = 1369* \\frac {8}{3}$, and $BC$ is $1369$.\n Hence $\\frac {m}{n} = \\frac {8}{3}$, $m + n = \\boxed{11}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes A B C D I :: point \nand AB AC BC CD :: real\nand \\<omega> :: circle\nassumes h0 : \"AC = 12\"\nand h1 : \"BC = 35\"\nand h2 : \"AB = sqrt (AC^2 + BC^2)\"\nand h3 : \"CD = sqrt (AC * BC)\"\nand h4 : \"\\<omega> = circle (midpoint C D) (CD / 2)\"\nand h5 : \"tangent (line A I) \\<omega>\"\nand h6 : \"tangent (line B I) \\<omega>\"\nand h7 : \"I \\<notin> triangle A B C\"\nshows  \"Ratreal (perimeter (triangle A B I) / length AB) = Ratreal (7/8)\"\nand \"gcd 7 8 = 1\"\n\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "In a right-angled triangle ABC, AC = 12 and BC = 35. The hypotenuse AB is calculated using Pythagoras' theorem. Also, there is a line CD with length equal to the geometric mean of AC and BC. A circle with center at the midpoint of CD and radius equal to half of CD is drawn. The lines AI and BI are tangents to the circle, with the point I located outside the triangle ABC. Find the ratio of the perimeter of the triangle ABI to the length of AB. The answer should be a simplified fraction with numerator and denominator being relatively prime. The final answer is $\\frac{7}{8}$, and gcd(7,8) = 1."
