If the Cubs win each game with probability $\\dfrac{3}{5}$ and there are no ties, what is the probability that the Cubs will win the World Series? Express your answer as a percent rounded to the nearest whole percent. The final Answer is 71\n ### Proof\n There are four possible cases for the Cubs winning the World Series, depending on the number of games that Red Sox win before the Cubs win their fourth game: the Red Sox can win no games, one game, two games, or three games.\n In general, if the Red Sox win exactly $k$ games before the Cubs win their 4th game, there will be a total of $3+k$ games played before the last one (which the Cubs must win), there will be a total of $\\dbinom{3+k}{k}$ ways of selecting the games that the Red Sox win out of those, and for each of those arrangements the Cubs will win their 4 games with probability $\\left(\\dfrac{3}{5}\\right)^4$ and the Red Sox will win the $k$ games that are selected for them with probability $\\left(\\dfrac{2}{5}\\right)^k$, so we are left to evaluate the expression $\\dbinom{3+k}{k}\\left(\\dfrac{3}{5}\\right)^4\\left(\\dfrac{2}{5}\\right)^k$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, 3$.\n This gives us our final probability of  \\begin{align} &\\dbinom{3}{0}\\left(\\dfrac{3}{5}\\right)^4\\left(\\dfrac{2}{5}\\right)^0 + \\dbinom{3+1}{1}\\left(\\dfrac{3}{5}\\right)^4\\left(\\dfrac{2}{5}\\right)^1 + \\\\ &\\qquad\\qquad\\dbinom{3+2}{2}\\left(\\dfrac{3}{5}\\right)^4\\left(\\dfrac{2}{5}\\right)^2 + \\dbinom{3+3}{3}\\left(\\dfrac{3}{5}\\right)^4\\left(\\dfrac{2}{5}\\right)^3\n \\end{align} which simplifies to  \\begin{align} &\\ \\ \\ \\ 1\\cdot(.1296)\\cdot1+4\\cdot(.1296)\\cdot(.4)\\\\ &+10\\cdot(.1296)\\cdot(.16)+20\\cdot(.1296)\\cdot(.064)=.7102\\ldots, \\end{align} so our answer is $\\boxed{71}$ percent.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes p_cubs :: real\nassumes h0 : \"p_cubs = 3/5\"\nand h1 : \"\\<forall>n. 0 \\<le> n \\<and> n < 4 \\<longrightarrow> (binomial 7 n) * (p_cubs powr (4 - n)) * ((1 - p_cubs) powr n) > 0\"\nand h2 : \"p_cubs_world_series = (\\<Sum>n = 0..3.
