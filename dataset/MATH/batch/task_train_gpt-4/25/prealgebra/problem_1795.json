Then, the lengths of the left/right exterior edges are $x+2$ inches. The area of the frame is equal to the area of the frame rectangle minus the area of the hole.\n This is equal to $5\\cdot(x+2)-3x=2x+10$. Since we are given that this area is 18 square inches, we have the equation $2x+10=18\\Rightarrow x=4$.\n So the dimensions of the interior hole are $3\\times4$.\n Thus, the sum of the four interior edges is $3+4+3+4=\\boxed{14}$ inches.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes l w :: real\nassumes h0 : \"l * w = 18\"\nand h1 : \"l + w = 5\"\nshows  \"2 * l + 2 * w - 4 = 14\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
