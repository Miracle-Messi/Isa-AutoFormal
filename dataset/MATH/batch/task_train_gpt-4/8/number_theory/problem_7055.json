        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n How many positive integer divisors of $2004^{2004}$ are divisible by exactly 2004 positive integers?\n The final Answer is 54\n ### Proof\n The prime factorization of 2004 is $2^2\\cdot 3\\cdot 167$.\n Thus the prime factorization of $2004^{2004}$ is $2^{4008}\\cdot 3^{2004}\\cdot 167^{2004}$.\n We can count the number of divisors of a number by multiplying together one more than each of the exponents of the prime factors in its prime factorization. For example, the number of divisors of $2004=2^2\\cdot 3^1\\cdot 167^1$ is $(2+1)(1+1)(1+1)=12$.\n A positive integer divisor of $2004^{2004}$ will be of the form $2^a\\cdot 3^b\\cdot 167^c$.\n Thus we need to find how many $(a,b,c)$ satisfy $(a+1)(b+1)(c+1)=2^2\\cdot 3\\cdot 167.$\n We can think of this as partitioning the exponents to $a+1,$ $b+1,$ and $c+1$.\n So let's partition the 2's first. There are two 2's so this is equivalent to partitioning two items in three containers.\n We can do this in ${4 \\choose 2} = 6$ ways.\n We can partition the 3 in three ways and likewise we can partition the 167 in three ways.\n So we have $6\\cdot 3\\cdot 3 = \\boxed{54}$ as our answer.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes n d :: nat\nassumes h0 : \"n = 2004^2004\"\nand h1 : \"\\<forall>d. d dvd n \\<longrightarrow> card {x. x \\<le> n \\<and> x dvd d} = 2004 \\<longrightarrow> d \\<in> D\"\nshows  \"card D = 54\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
