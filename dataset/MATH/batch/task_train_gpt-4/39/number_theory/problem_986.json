The distributive property gives us   $$8 - 2a = 2 \\cdot 4 - 2a = 2(4 -a),$$so $2$ is a factor of $3b$. Note that   $$b = 3b - 2b,$$so since $2$ is a factor of $3b$ and $2$ is a factor of $2b,$ $2$ must be a factor of $b.$ So we can say $b = 2n$ for some integer $n$.\n Substituting gives us    \\begin{align} 2b + 12 &= 2(2n) + 12\\\\ &= 4n + 4 \\cdot 3\\\\ &= 4(n + 3), \\end{align}so $4$ is a factor of $2b + 12$. Since $1,$ $2,$ and $4$ are factors of $4$ and $4$ is a factor of $2b + 12$, it must be true that $1,$ $2,$ and $4$ are factors of $2b + 12$.\n So our final answer is $\\boxed{3}.$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes a b :: int\nassumes h0 : \"3 * b = 8 - 2 * a\"\nshows  \"card {n. n \\<in> {1..6} \\<and> (2 * b + 12) mod n = 0} = 3\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "For two integers $a$ and $b$ where $3b = 8 - 2a$, find the number of integers $n$ in the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$ such that $(2b + 12)$ is divisible by $n$. The final answer is $3$."
