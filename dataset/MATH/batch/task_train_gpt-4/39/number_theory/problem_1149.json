If the integer is divisible by 11, what is the integer? The final Answer is 3542\n ### Proof\n Let the integer be $abcd$.\n We know that \\begin{align} a+b+c+d&=14,\\\\ b+c&=9,\\\\ a-d&=1. \\end{align} Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get $a+d=5$.\n Adding this to the third equation, we get $$2a=6\\Rightarrow a=3$$ Substituting this into the third equation, we get $d=2$.\n Now, the fact that the integer is divisible by $11$ means that $a-b+c-d$ is divisible by $11$.\n Substituting in the values for $a$ and $d$, this means that $1-b+c$ is divisible by $11$. If this quantity was a positive or negative multiple of $11$, either $b$ or $c$ would need to be greater than $9$, so we must have $1-b+c=0$.\n With the second equation above, we now have \\begin{align} c-b&=-1,\\\\ c+b&=9. \\end{align} Adding these equations, we get $2c=8$, or $c=4$.\n Substituting this back in, we get $b=5$.\n Thus the integer is $\\boxed{3542}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes a b c d :: int\nassumes h0 : \"a + b + c + d = 14\"\nand h1 : \"b + c = 9\"\nand h2 : \"a - d = 1\"\nand h3 : \"11 dvd (1000*a + 100*b + 10*c + d)\"\nshows  \"1000*a + 100*b + 10*c + d = 3542\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "Find four integers $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ such that $a + b + c + d = 14$, $b + c = 9$, $a - d = 1$, and the integer formed by concatenating $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ is divisible by $11$. The correct combination is $3542$."
