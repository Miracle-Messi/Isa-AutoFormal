The final Answer is 75\n ### Proof\n Noelle only has to do 1 homework assignment to earn her first point, and the same is true for each of her first five points. She must then do 2 homework assignments to earn her sixth point, seventh point, and so on, up to her tenth point.\n Continuing, we see that Noelle must do a total of \\[1+1+1+1+1+2+2+2+2+2+\\dots+5+5+5+5+5\\] homework assignments to earn 25 points. This sum may be rewritten as $5(1+2+3+4+5)=5(15)=\\boxed{75}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes n :: nat and points :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> nat\"\nassumes h0 : \"points 0 = 0\"\nand h1 : \"\\<forall>n. points (n + 1) = points n + \\<lceil>(n + 1) / 5\\<rceil>\"\nand h2 : \"points 25 = 75\"\nshows  \"points 25 = (\\<Sum>n \\<le> 24. \\<lceil>(n + 1) / 5\\<rceil>)\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "A sequence of points is defined as follows: the first term is 0, and each subsequent term is obtained by adding the ceiling of the current term index divided by 5 to the previous term ($points_{n+1} = points_n + \\lceil{\\frac{n+1}{5}}\\rceil$). If the 26th term in the sequence is 75, find the sum of the first 25 terms, i.e., $\\sum_{n=1}^{24} \\lceil{\\frac{n+1}{5}}\\rceil$."
