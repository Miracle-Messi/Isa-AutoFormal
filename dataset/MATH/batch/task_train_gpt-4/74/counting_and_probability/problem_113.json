If we build the string from the beginning, we have different possibilities to check. For example, the second digit is 9, but the third digit could be 3 or 5.\n However, no units digit appears more than once, so if we build the string in reverse then the order is determined. If the 2002nd digit is 9, then the 2001st digit is 1, the 2000th digit is 3, the 1999th digit is 9, etc.\n Therefore, the first digit would be 9.\n So if the first digit is 1, then the final digit cannot be 9. If the 2002nd digit is 8, the the 2001st digit is 3, the 2000th digit is 9, the 1999th digit is 1, the 1998th digit is 3, etc. In this case, the first digit is 1, so the maximum possible last digit is $\\boxed{8}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes s :: \"nat list\" and n :: nat\nassumes h0 : \"length s = 2002\"\nand h1 : \"hd s = 1\"\nand h2 : \"\\<forall>i. i \\<in> {0..< length s - 1} \\<longrightarrow> (s ! i * 10 + s !

        "informal problem": "A sequence of 2002 natural numbers starts with the number 1. For each pair of consecutive numbers in the sequence, their product multiplied by 10 and then added together is divisible by either 19 or 31. Find the last number in the sequence. The final answer is 8."
