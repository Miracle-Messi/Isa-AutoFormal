        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n Bicycle license plates in Flatville each contain three letters. The first is chosen from the set $\\{C,H,L,P,R\\},$ the second from $\\{A,I,O\\},$ and the third from $\\{D,M,N,T\\}.$\n\nWhen Flatville needed more license plates, they added two new letters. The new letters may both be added to one set or one letter may be added to one set and one to another set. What is the largest possible number of ADDITIONAL license plates that can be made by adding two letters? The final Answer is 40\n ### Proof\n Before new letters were added, five different letters could have been chosen for the first position, three for the second, and four for the third. This means that $5\\cdot 3\\cdot 4=60$ plates could have been made.\n If two letters are added to the second set, then $5\\cdot 5\\cdot 4=100$ plates can be made. If one letter is added to each of the second and third sets, then $5\\cdot 4\\cdot 5=100$ plates can be made.

The factory plans to increase the number of rows and/or columns by a total of 2. If the number of added rows (x) and the number of added columns (y) are both non-negative, what is the maximum increase in the total number of plates that can be produced? The final answer is 40."
