The final Answer is 64\\sqrt{2}\n ### Proof\n We'll use this helpful result a few times: for any real numbers $a$ and $b$, the graph of \\[|x-a|+|y-b|=1\\]is a \"diamond\": a square of side length $\\sqrt{2}$ centered at $(a, b)$ whose sides form angles of $45^\\circ$ with the axes.\n (To see this, first draw the graph of $|x| + |y| = 1$. Then, the graph of $|x-a|+|y-b|=1$ is just the result of translating in the $x$-direction by $a$, and then in the $y$-direction by $b$.) Since the given equation only involves $|x|$ and $|y|$, it is symmetric about the two axes.\n That is, it is sufficient to consider only the first quadrant, and then multiply our answer by $4$ to account for all four quadrants.\n So, assume $x, y \\ge 0$.Then the equation becomes \\[\\Big|\\big| x-2\\big|-1\\Big|+\\Big|\\big| y-2\\big|-1\\Big|=1.\\]Seeing $|x-2|$ and $|y-2|$, we take cases on the values of $x$ and $y$ relative to $2$: If $0 \\le x, y \\le 2$, then the given equation becomes \\[\\Big|(2-x)-1\\Big|+\\Big|(2-y)-1\\Big|=1 \\implies |1-x| + |1-y| = 1.\\]This is the equation of the standard diamond centered at $(1, 1)$, which is completely contained in the region $0 \\le x, y \\le 2$.\n If $0 \\le x \\le 2 \\le y$, then the given equation becomes \\[\\Big|(2-x)-1\\Big|+\\Big|(y-2)-1\\Big|=1 \\implies |1-x| + |y-3| = 1.\\]This is the equation of the standard diamond centered at $(1, 3)$, which is again contained in the correct region.\n If $0 \\le y \\le 2 \\le x$, then we get the standard diamond centered at $(3,1)$, as in the last case. If $2 \\le x, y$, then the given equation becomes \\[\\Big|(x-2)-1\\Big|+\\Big|(y-2)-1\\Big|=1 \\implies |x-3| + |y-3| = 1.\\]This is the equation of the standard diamond centered at $(3, 3)$, which is again contained in the region $2 \\le x, y$.\n Thus, the graph of the given equation in the first quadrant consists of four standard diamonds, so the graph of the given equation in the whole plane consists of $4 \\cdot 4 = 16$ standard diamonds. These diamonds do not overlap, and each one has perimeter $4\\sqrt{2}$.\n So, the overall length of the lines that make up the graph is $16 \\cdot 4\\sqrt{2} = \\boxed{64\\sqrt{2}}$.
