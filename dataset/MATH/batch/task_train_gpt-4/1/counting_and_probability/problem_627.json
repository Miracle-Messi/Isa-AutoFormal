Three of the faces on Noah's cube have a 2 and three of the faces have a 6. All three cubes are rolled. What is the probability that Allison's roll is greater than each of Brian's and Noah's? Express your answer as a common fraction. The final Answer is \\frac{1}{3}\n ### Proof\n Since Allison will always roll a 5, we must calculate the probability that both Brian and Noah roll a 4 or lower. The probability of Brian rolling a 4 or lower is $\\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}$ since Brian has a standard die.\n Noah, however, has a $\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$ probability of rolling a 4 or lower, since the only way he can do so is by rolling one of his 3 sides that have a 2.\n So, the probability of both of these independent events occurring is $\\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes A B N :: \"real set\"\nassumes h0 : \"A = {5}\"\nand h1 : \"B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\"\nand h2 : \"N = {2, 2, 2, 6, 6, 6}\"\nand h3 : \"random A \\<and> random B \\<and> random N\"\nshows  \"P (A > B \\<and> A > N) = 1 / 3\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "In a probability experiment, there are three sets: $A = \\{5\\}$, $B = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$, and $N = \\{2, 2, 2, 6, 6, 6\\}$. If a random element is picked from each set ($A$, $B$, and $N$), what is the probability that the element from $A$ is greater than the elements from $B$ and $N$? The final answer is $\\frac{1}{3}$."
