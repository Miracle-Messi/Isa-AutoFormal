        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n Two rectangles have integer dimensions, and both have a perimeter of 144 cm. What is the greatest possible difference between the areas of two such rectangles? The final Answer is 1225\n ### Proof\n Let the dimensions of the rectangle be $l$ and $w$.\n We are given $2l+2w=144$, which implies $l+w=72$.\n Solving for $w$, we have $w=72-l$. The area of the rectangle is $lw=l(72-l)$. As a function of $l$, this expression is a parabola whose zeros are at $l=0$ and $l=72$ (see graph). The $y$-coordinate of a point on the parabola is maximized when the $x$-coordinate is chosen as close to the $x$-coordinate of the vertex as possible.\n The $x$-coordinate of the vertex is halfway between the zeros at $x=(0+72)/2=36$, so the maximum area is $(36)(36)=1296$ square units.\n Similarly, to minimize the area we choose the length to be as far from $36$ as possible.
