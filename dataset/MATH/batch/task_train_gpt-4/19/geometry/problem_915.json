        "informal problem": "Given three points P, Q, and R in a two-dimensional space, the distance between P and Q is the same as the distance between Q and R, and this distance is 34 units. The distance between P and R is 32 units. M is the midpoint of Q and R. Find the distance from P to M. The final answer is $3 \\sqrt{89}$ units."
