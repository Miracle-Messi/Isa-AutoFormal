        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n Let $f$ be a function taking the nonnegative integers to the nonnegative integers, such that\n\\[2f(a^2 + b^2) = [f(a)]^2 + [f(b)]^2\\]for all nonnegative integers $a$ and $b.$\n\nLet $n$ be the number of possible values of $f(25),$ and let $s$ be the sum of the possible values of $f(25).$  Find $n \\times s.$ The final Answer is 153\n ### Proof\n Setting $a = 0$ and $b = 0$ in the given functional equation, we get \\[2f(0) = 2f[(0)]^2.\\]Hence, $f(0) = 0$ or $f(0) = 1.$ Setting $a = 0$ and $b = 1$ in the given functional equation, we get \\[2f(1) = [f(0)]^2 + [f(1)]^2.\\]If $f(0) = 0,$ then $2f(1) = [f(1)]^2,$ which means $f(1) = 0$ or $f(1) = 2.$  If $f(0) = 1,$ then $[f(1)]^2 - 2f(1) + 1 = [f(1) - 1]^2 = 0,$ so $f(1) = 1.$\n We divide into cases accordingly, but before we do so, note that we can get to $f(25)$ with the following values: \\begin{align} a = 1, b = 1: \\ & 2f(2) = 2[f(1)]^2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad f(2) = [f(1)]^2 \\\\\n a = 1, b = 2: \\ & 2f(5) = [f(1)]^2 + [f(2)]^2 \\\\ a = 0, b = 5: \\ & 2f(25) = [f(0)]^2 + [f(5)]^2 \\end{align}Case 1: $f(0) = 0$ and $f(1) = 0.$\n From the equations above, $f(2) = [f(1)]^2 = 0,$ $2f(5) = [f(1)]^2 + [f(2)]^2 = 0$ so $f(5) = 0,$ and $2f(25) = [f(0)]^2 + [f(5)]^2 = 0,$ so $f(25) = 0.$ Note that the function $f(n) = 0$ satisfies the given functional equation, which shows that $f(25)$ can take on the value of 0.\n Case 2: $f(0) = 0$ and $f(1) = 2.$\n From the equations above, $f(2) = [f(1)]^2 = 4,$ $2f(5) = [f(1)]^2 + [f(2)]^2 = 20$ so $f(5) = 10,$ and $2f(25) = [f(0)]^2 + [f(5)]^2 = 100,$ so $f(25) = 50.$ Note that the function $f(n) = 2n$ satisfies the given functional equation, which shows that $f(25)$ can take on the value of 50.\n Case 3: $f(0) = 1$ and $f(1) = 1.$\n From the equations above, $f(2) = [f(1)]^2 = 1,$ $2f(5) = [f(1)]^2 + [f(2)]^2 = 2$ so $f(5) = 1,$ and $2f(25) = [f(0)]^2 + [f(5)]^2 = 2,$ so $f(25) = 1.$ Note that the function $f(n) = 1$ satisfies the given functional equation, which shows that $f(25)$ can take on the value of 1.\n Hence, there are $n = 3$ different possible values of $f(25),$ and their sum is $s = 0 + 50 + 1 = 51,$ which gives a final answer of $n \\times s = 3 \\times 51 = \\boxed{153}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes f :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> nat\" and n s :: nat\nassumes h0 : \"\\<forall> a b. 2 * f (a^2 + b^2) = (f a)^2 + (f b)^2\"\nand h1 : \"n = card {f 25 | f. \\<forall> a b. 2 * f (a^2 + b^2) = (f a)^2 + (f b)^2}\"\nand h2 : \"s = sum id {f 25 | f. \\<forall> a b. 2 * f (a^2 + b^2) = (f a)^2 + (f b)^2}\"\nshows  \"n * s = 153\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
