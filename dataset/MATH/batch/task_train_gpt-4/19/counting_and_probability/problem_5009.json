Find the value of $n$.\n The final Answer is 182\n ### Proof\n Let $P(n)$ denote the probability that the bug is at $A$ after it has crawled $n$ meters. Since the bug can only be at vertex $A$ if it just left a vertex which is not $A$, we have $P(n + 1) = \\frac13 (1 - P(n))$.\n We also know $P(0) = 1$, so we can quickly compute $P(1)=0$, $P(2) = \\frac 13$, $P(3) = \\frac29$, $P(4) = \\frac7{27}$, $P(5) = \\frac{20}{81}$, $P(6) = \\frac{61}{243}$ and $P(7) = \\frac{182}{729}$, so the answer is $\\boxed{182}$.\n One can solve this recursion fairly easily to determine a closed-form expression for $P(n)$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes p n :: real\nassumes h0 : \"p = n / 729\"\nand h1 : \"prob_at_vertex_A 7 = p\"\nshows  \"n = 182\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "If the probability at vertex A after 7 moves is equal to the ratio of n to 729, i.e., $p = \\frac{n}{729}$, find the value of n when the probability at vertex A is equal to p. The final answer is 182."
