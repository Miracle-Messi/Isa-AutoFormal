Let $N$ be the number of primes appearing in this sequence. Then $N$ is:\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 0\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 16\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 17\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 57\\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 58$\n The final Answer is \n ### Proof\n First, note that $n$ does not have a prime number larger than $61$ as one of its factors. Also, note that $n$ does not equal $1$.\n Therefore, since the prime factorization of $n$ only has primes from $2$ to $59$, $n$ and $P$ share at least one common factor other than $1$.\n Therefore $P+n$ is not prime for any $n$, so the answer is $\\boxed{}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes P N n :: nat\nassumes h0 : \"P = 2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 17 * 19 * 23 * 29 * 31 * 37 * 41 * 43 * 47 * 53 * 59 * 61\"\nand h1 : \"N = card {x. prime x \\<and> x \\<in> {P + n |n. 2 \\<le> n \\<and> n \\<le> 59}}\"\nshows  \"N = 0\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
