The final Answer is 39\n ### Proof\n At any point on Charlyn's walk, she can see all the points inside a circle of radius 1 km. The portion of the viewable region inside the square consists of the interior of the square except for a smaller square with side length 3 km.\n This portion of the viewable region has area $(25-9)$ km$^2$. The portion of the viewable region outside the square consists of four rectangles, each 5 km by 1 km, and four quarter-circles, each with a radius of 1 km.\n This portion of the viewable region has area $4 \\left(5+\\frac{\\pi}{4} \\right)=(20+\\pi)\\text{ km}^2$. The area of the entire viewable region is $36+\\pi\\approx \\boxed{39}\\text{ km}^2$.

However, we could define the process in Isabelle as follows:\n\nWe could define a function to calculate the area of the square, a function to calculate the area of the circles she can see from the corners, and a function to calculate the area of the rectangles she can see from the edges. Then we can define a function to sum these areas and round to the nearest whole number. But note that this would involve assumptions and approximations, as Isabelle does not directly support geometric calculations or rounding to the nearest whole number.\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "The given Isabelle version is incorrect, it seems to be a commentary or explanation rather than an actual Isabelle theorem or function. Based on the explanation given, it seems the problem might be something like:\n\nA person is standing in a square room and can see certain areas on the floor depending on her position. Calculate the total area she can see by adding up the area of the square, the areas of the circles she can see from the corners, and the areas of the rectangles she can see from the edges. Round the final result to the nearest whole number. Note that this problem involves geometric calculations and rounding to the nearest whole number."
