Hoses A and C together take 5 hours to fill the pool. Hoses B and C together take 6 hours to fill the pool. How many hours does it take hoses A, B and C working together to fill the pool? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth. The final Answer is 3.24\n ### Proof\n Let the rate that hose $A$ fills the pool be equal to $A$, and similarly for hoses $B$ and $C$. Then, let $P$ be equal to the volume of the pool.\n From the given information, we can write the equation $P=4(A+B)$, which just says the pool volume is equal to the rate it is being filled, multiplied by the time taken to fill it.\n We can rewrite this as $\\frac{P}{4}=A+B$. Doing this with the rest of the given information, we can write three equations: $$\\frac{P}{4}=A+B$$ $$\\frac{P}{5}=A+C$$ $$\\frac{P}{6}=B+C$$ Adding these three equations, we can simplify as shown: \\begin{align}\n \\frac{P}{4}+\\frac{P}{5}+\\frac{P}{6}&=(A+B)+(A+C)+(B+C)\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad \\frac{15P}{60}+\\frac{12P}{60}+\\frac{10P}{60}&=2(A+B+C)\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad 37P&=120(A+B+C)\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad P&=\\frac{120}{37}(A+B+C)\n \\end{align} Looking carefully at the final expression here, we can see that $A+B+C$ is the rate that the pool would be filled with all three hoses working together.\n So, $\\frac{120}{37}\\approx \\boxed{3.24}$ is equal to the number of hours it would take all three hoses to fill the pool.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes A B C :: real\nassumes h0 : \"0 < A\"\nand h1 : \"0 < B\"\nand h2 : \"0 < C\"\nand h3 : \"1 / (A + B) = 4 / (4 * A * B)\"\nand h4 : \"1 / (A + C) = 5 / (5 * A * C)\"\nand h5 : \"1 / (B + C) = 6 / (6 * B * C)\"\nshows  \"\\<exists> time. time > 0 \\<and> 1 / (A + B + C) = time / (time * A * B * C) \\<and> abs(time - 3.24) < 0.01\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
