The carrier notices that no two adjacent houses ever get mail on the same day, but that there are never more than two houses in a row that get no mail on the same day. How many different patterns of mail delivery are possible?\n The final Answer is 351\n ### Proof\n Let $0$ represent a house that does not receive mail and $1$ represent a house that does receive mail. This problem is now asking for the number of $19$-digit strings of $0$'s and $1$'s such that there are no two consecutive $1$'s and no three consecutive $0$'s.\n The last two digits of any $n$-digit string can't be $11$, so the only possibilities are $00$, $01$, and $10$.\n Let $a_n$ be the number of $n$-digit strings ending in $00$, $b_n$ be the number of $n$-digit strings ending in $01$, and $c_n$ be the number of $n$-digit strings ending in $10$. If an $n$-digit string ends in $00$, then the previous digit must be a $1$, and the last two digits of the $n-1$ digits substring will be $10$.\n So\\[a_{n} = c_{n-1}.\\] If an $n$-digit string ends in $01$, then the previous digit can be either a $0$ or a $1$, and the last two digits of the $n-1$ digits substring can be either $00$ or $10$. So\\[b_{n} = a_{n-1} + c_{n-1}.\\]\n If an $n$-digit string ends in $10$, then the previous digit must be a $0$, and the last two digits of the $n-1$ digits substring will be $01$.
