In particular, $0:1$ is the same as $0:2$ and $0:3$, and $1:0$ is the same as $2:0$, $3:0$, and $4:0$. Also, $1:1$ is the same as $2:2$ and $3:3$, and $2:1$ is the same as $4:2$.\n Thus, we have over-counted by $8$ ratios, so our final answer is $19 - 8 = \\boxed{11}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes red green :: nat and flavors :: \"nat set\"\nassumes h0 : \"red = 4\"\nand h1 : \"green = 3\"\nand h2 : \"flavors = { (r, g). r \\<le> red \\<and> g \\<le> green \\<and> r * green \\<noteq> g * red }\"\nand h3 : \"card flavors = 11\"\nshows  \"card flavors = 11\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "There are 4 red and 3 green objects. A set is formed by selecting pairs of objects, where the number of red objects in the pair is less than or equal to the total number of red objects, and the number of green objects is less than or equal to the total number of green objects. However, the pairs are such that the product of red objects and the total number of green objects is not equal to the product of green objects and the total number of red objects. How many pairs are in the set? The final answer is 11."
