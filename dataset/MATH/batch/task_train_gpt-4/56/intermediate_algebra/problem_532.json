Comparing these quantities directly is a chore. Instead, we note that the first and third choices are both of the form $\\frac{n}{n-1}+\\frac{n}{n+1}$ for $n=2006$ and $n=2007$.\n Rewriting this expression algebraically leads to \\[ \\frac{n(n+1)}{n^2-1}+\\frac{n(n-1)}{n^2-1} = \\frac{2n^2}{n^2-1} = 2 + \\frac{2}{n^2-1}. \\]In particular both $A$ and $C$ are larger than 2. It is easy to verify that choice $B$ is equal to 2, so it cannot be the answer.\n Finally, note that larger values of $n$ produce smaller results, implying that $\\boxed{\\text{A}}$ is the largest. (It is also possible to guess the answer by trying examples involving much smaller numbers.)\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes A B C :: real\nassumes h0 : \"A = (2006/2005) + (2006/2007)\"\nand h1 : \"B = (2006/2007) + (2008/2007)\"\nand h2 : \"C = (2007/2006) + (2007/2008)\"\nshows  \"max (max A B) C = A\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
