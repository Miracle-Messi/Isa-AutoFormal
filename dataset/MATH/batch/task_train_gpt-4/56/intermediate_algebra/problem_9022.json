That means $r_1^2 + r_2^2 = s^2 - 2p = s$ and $r_1^3 + r_1^3 = (r_1 + r_2)^3 - 3r_1^2r_2 - 3r_1r_2^2 = s^3 - 3ps$. Note that $s = s^2 - 2p$, so $p = \\frac{s^2 - s}{2}$.\n We also know that $s = s^3 - 3ps$, so substituting for $p$ results in \\begin{align} s &= s^3 - 3s \\cdot \\frac{s^2 - s}{2} \\\\ s &= s^3 - \\tfrac32 s^3 + \\tfrac32 s^2 \\\\ 0 &= -\\tfrac12 s^3 + \\tfrac32 s^2 - s \\\\ 0 &= s^3 - 3s^2 + 2s \\\\ &= s(s-2)(s-1) \\end{align}\n Thus, $s = 0,1,2$.

Since $1^n = 1$ for $1 \\le n \\le 2007$, this result satisfies all conditions.\n Thus, $\\dfrac1{r_1^{2008}}+\\dfrac1{r_2^{2008}} = 1+1 = \\boxed{2}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes r1 r2 :: real\nassumes h0 : \"\\<forall>n. n \\<le> 2007 \\<longrightarrow> r1 powr n + r2 powr n = r1 + r2\"\nshows  \"max (1 / (r1 powr 2008) + 1 / (r2 powr 2008)) = 2\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
