        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n Let $A = (-3, 0),$ $B=(-2,1),$ $C=(2,1),$ and $D=(3,0).$ Suppose that point $P$ satisfies \\[PA + PD = PB + PC = 8.\\]Then the $y-$coordinate of $P,$ when simplified, can be expressed in the form $\\frac{-a + b \\sqrt{c}}{d},$ where $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ $d$ are positive integers.  Find $a + b + c + d.$ The final Answer is 35\n ### Proof\n Since $PA + PD = 8,$ point $P$ must lie on the ellipse whose foci are $A$ and $D,$ and whose major axis has length $8.$ Since the distance between the foci is $3 - (-3) = 6,$ the minor axis has length $\\sqrt{8^2 - 6^2} = 2\\sqrt{7}.$ Then the semi-axes have lengths $4$ and $\\sqrt{7},$ respectively, and the center of the ellipse is $(0,0),$ so the equation of this ellipse is \\[\\frac{x^2}{16} + \\frac{y^2}{7} = 1.\\]Similarly, since $PB+PC=8,$ point $P$ must lie on the ellipse whose foci are $B$ and $C,$ and whose major axis has length $8.$ Since the distance between the foci is $2-(-2) = 4,$ the minor axis has length $\\sqrt{8^2-4^2} = 4\\sqrt{3}.$ Then the semi-axes have lengths $4$ and $2\\sqrt{3},$ respectively, and the center of the ellipse is $(0,1),$ so the equation of this ellipse is \\[\\frac{x^2}{16} + \\frac{(y-1)^2}{12} = 1.\\]Both ellipses are shown below.\n (Note that they intersect at two different points, but that they appear to have the same $y-$coordinate.)
