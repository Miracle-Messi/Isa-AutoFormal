        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n An equilateral triangle has an area of $64\\sqrt{3}$ $\\text{cm}^2$. If each side of the triangle is decreased by 4 cm, by how many square centimeters is the area decreased? The final Answer is 28\\sqrt{3}\n ### Proof\n We first consider an equilateral triangle with side length $s$. If we construct an altitude, it will divide the equilateral triangle into two congruent $30-60-90$ triangles with the longest side having length $s$ and the altitude opposite the $60^\\circ$ angle.\n Since the side lengths of a $30-60-90$ triangle are in a $1:\\sqrt{3}:2$ ratio, the altitude will have length $\\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Since the base of this equilateral triangle is $s$, its area will be $\\frac{1}{2}{b}{h}=\\frac{1}{2}s \\left(\\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)=\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}$.\n Now we can set this expression equal to $64\\sqrt{3}$ and solve for $s$ to find the side length of our original triangle.
