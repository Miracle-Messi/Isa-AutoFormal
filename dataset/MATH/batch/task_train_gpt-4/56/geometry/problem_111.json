Power of a point at $P$ gives $AP \\cdot PC = BP \\cdot PD$ or $8=x(6-x)$. This can be solved for $x=2$ and $x=4$, and we discard the latter, leaving $BP = \\boxed{2}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes A B C D P :: \"real*real\"\nand AP PC BD BP DP :: real\nassumes h0 : \"dist A P = 8\"\nand h1 : \"dist P C = 1\"\nand h2 : \"dist B D = 6\"\nand h3 : \"P = line_intersection (A, C) (B, D)\"\nand h4 : \"BP < DP\"\nshows  \"BP = 2\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "Given points A, B, C, D and P in a plane with distances AP = 8, PC = 1, and BD = 6. If point P is the intersection of line AC and BD, and the distance from B to P is less than the distance from D to P, find the distance from B to P. The final answer is 2."
