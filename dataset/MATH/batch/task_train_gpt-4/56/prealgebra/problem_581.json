        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n The area of the shaded region is 78 square inches. All angles are right angles and all measurements are given in inches. What is the perimeter of the non-shaded region?\n\n[asy]size(101);\nfilldraw(((0,0)--(0,8)--(10,8)--(10,-2)--(6,-2)--(6,0)--cycle^^(2.5,3)--(2.5,5)--(7.5,5)--(7.5,3)--cycle),gray(.6)+fillrule(1),linewidth(1));\nlabel(\"$2''$\",(5.3,-1),fontsize(10pt));\nlabel(\"$4''$\",(8,-2.7),fontsize(10pt));\nlabel(\"$2''$\",(3.3,4),fontsize(10pt));\nlabel(\"$10''$\",(5,8.7),fontsize(10pt));\nlabel(\"$10''$\",(11,3),fontsize(10pt));[/asy] The final Answer is 14\n ### Proof\n Breaking the outer figure into two rectangles, we find that the total area of the shaded region plus unshaded region is $10\\cdot 8 + 2\\cdot 4 = 88$.\n Thus the area of the non-shaded region is $88-78 = 10$ square inches. This means that its remaining side length is 5 inches, and its perimeter is $2(2 + 5) = \\boxed{14}$ inches.\n *)\n\nApologies for any confusion, but the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover currently does not directly support geometric problems with diagrams. The geometrical problems need to be translated into algebraic or logical forms which can then be represented in Isabelle. For example, the problem could be translated into statements about the sum of lengths, areas etc., which are then used to solve the problem. In this case, it's not clear how the area of the shaded region being 78 square inches relates to the perimeter of the non-shaded region, or how these are defined. If more information is provided, it might be possible to translate this into an Isabelle representation.\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "Your statement appears to be an explanation rather than a mathematical problem that can be translated. The explanation discusses the limitations of the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover in handling geometric problems with diagrams. It suggests that such problems need to be translated into algebraic or logical forms to be represented in Isabelle. Without a specific problem, it's not possible to provide a translation."
