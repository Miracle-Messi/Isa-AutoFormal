A photoelectric eye by the side of the road counts the number of cars that pass in one hour. Assuming that each car is 4 meters long and that the cars can travel at any speed, let $M$ be the maximum whole number of cars that can pass the photoelectric eye in one hour. Find the quotient when $M$ is divided by $10$.\n The final Answer is 375\n ### Proof\n Let $n$ be the number of car lengths that separates each car. Then their speed is at most $15n$.\n Let a unit be the distance between the cars (front to front). Then the length of each unit is $4(n + 1)$.\n To maximize, in a unit, the CAR comes first, THEN the empty space.\n So at time zero, the car is right at the eye.\n Hence, we count the number of units that pass the eye in an hour: $\\frac {15,000n\\frac{\\text{meters}}{\\text{hour}}}{4(n + 1)\\frac{\\text{meters}}{\\text{unit}}} = \\frac {15,000n}{4(n + 1)}\\frac{\\text{units}}{\\text{hour}}$.\n We wish to maximize this.
