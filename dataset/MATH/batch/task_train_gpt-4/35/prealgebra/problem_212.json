        "informal problem": "There are four types of envelopes: A, B, C, and D. The length and height (in some unit) of each envelope are as follows:\n- Envelope A: length = 6, height = 4\n- Envelope B: length = 9, height = 3\n- Envelope C: length = 6, height = 6\n- Envelope D: length = 11, height = 4\n\nAn extra charge is applied if the ratio of length to height is less than 1.3 or more than 2.5. \n\nGiven a list of envelopes [A, B, C, D], how many envelopes will require an extra charge? The expected answer is 3."
