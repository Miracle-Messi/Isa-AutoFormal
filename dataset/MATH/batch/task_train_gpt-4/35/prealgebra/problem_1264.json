If you have an ordinary die, you may notice that the pairs of numbers which add up to $7$ are all on pairs of opposite faces.\n (For example, the $1$ is opposite the $6$.) This means that in order to paint two faces that don't add up to $7$, I must choose any two faces that aren't opposite. Two faces that aren't opposite must share an edge, and there is exactly one pair of faces meeting along each edge of the die.\n Since a cube has $12$ edges, there are $\\boxed{12}$ choices I can make.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes total_ways ways_sum_7 :: \"nat\"\nassumes h0 : \"total_ways = 6 choose 2\"\nand h1 : \"ways_sum_7 = 3\"\nshows  \"total_ways - ways_sum_7 = 12\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "If the total number of ways to choose 2 items from a set of 6 is reduced by the number of ways to sum 7 from the same set, which is 3, what is the remaining number of ways? The final answer is 12."
