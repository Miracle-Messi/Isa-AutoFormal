        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n Given that the diagonals of a rhombus are always perpendicular bisectors of each other, what is the area of a rhombus with side length $\\sqrt{89}$ units and diagonals that differ by 6 units? The final Answer is 80\n ### Proof\n Because the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other, they divide the rhombus into four congruent right triangles.\n Let $x$ be half of the length of the shorter diagonal of the rhombus. Then $x+3$ is half of the length of the longer diagonal. Also, $x$ and $x+3$ are the lengths of the legs of each of the right triangles.\n By the Pythagorean theorem,  \\[ x^2+(x+3)^2=\\left(\\sqrt{89}\\right)^2. \\] Expanding $(x+3)^2$ as $x^2+6x+9$ and moving every term to the left-hand side, the equation simplifies to $2x^2+6x-80=0$. The expression $2x^2+6x-80$ factors as $2(x-5)(x+8)$, so we find $x=5$ and $x=-8$.\n Discarding the negative solution, we calculate the area of the rhombus by multiplying the area of one of the right triangles by 4. The area of the rhombus is $4\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 5(5+3)\\right)=\\boxed{80}$ square units.\n [asy] unitsize(3mm); defaultpen(linewidth(0.7pt)+fontsize(11pt)); dotfactor=3; pair A=(8,0), B=(0,5), C=(-8,0), D=(0,-5), Ep = (0,0); draw(A--B--C--D--cycle); draw(A--C); draw(B--D); label(\"$x$\",midpoint(Ep--B),W);\n label(\"$x+3$\",midpoint(Ep--A),S); label(\"$\\sqrt{89}$\",midpoint(A--B),NE);[/asy]\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes a d1 d2 :: real\nassumes h0 : \"a = sqrt 89\"\nand h1 : \"d1 = d2 + 6\"\nand h2 : \"a^2 = (d1^2)/4 + (d2^2)/4\"\nshows  \"d1 * d2 / 2 = 80\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
