        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n The sequence 12, 15, 18, 21, 51, 81, $\\ldots$ consists of all positive multiples of 3 that contain at least one digit that is a 1. What is the $50^{\\mathrm{th}}$ term of the sequence? The final Answer is 318\n ### Proof\n We know that the rule for divisibility by $3$ is that the digits of the number must add up to a multiple of $3$.\n So, it's clear that there are no other such two-digit numbers beyond the ones listed in the problem. Every number divisible by $3$ between $100$ and $199$ is in the sequence, so that gets us through the $39$th term of the sequence.\n Using the rule for divisibility by $3$, it is fairly simple to list out the remaining $11$ terms of the sequence: $201, 210, 213, 216, 219, 231, 261, 291, 312, 315, 318$.\n Thus, the $50$th term is $\\boxed{318}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes f :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> nat\"\nassumes h0 : \"\\<forall> n. n \\<ge> 1 \\<longrightarrow> f n = 3 * n + 9\"\nand h1 : \"\\<forall> n. n \\<ge> 1 \\<longrightarrow> (\\<exists> m. m \\<ge> 1 \\<and> m \\<le> 9 \\<and> digit_of_nat (f n) m = 1)\"\nshows  \"f 50 = 318\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
