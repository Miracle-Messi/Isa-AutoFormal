There are $25$ points in all, from $(1,1)$ to $(5,5)$, so $\\dbinom{25}3$ is $\\frac{25\\cdot 24\\cdot 23}{3\\cdot 2 \\cdot 1}$, which simplifies to $2300$.\n Now we count the ones that are on the same line.\n We see that any three points chosen from $(1,1)$ and $(1,5)$ would be on the same line, so $\\dbinom53$ is $10$, and there are $5$ rows, $5$ columns, and $2$ long diagonals, so that results in $120$.\n We can also count the ones with $4$ on a diagonal. That is $\\dbinom43$, which is 4, and there are $4$ of those diagonals, so that results in $16$.\n We can count the ones with only $3$ on a diagonal, and there are $4$ diagonals like that, so that results in $4$.\n We can also count the ones with a slope of $\\frac12$, $2$, $-\\frac12$, or $-2$, with $3$ points in each. There are $12$ of them, so that results in $12$. Finally, we subtract all the ones in a line from $2300$, so we have $2300-120-16-4-12=\\boxed{2148}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes count :: int\nassumes h0 : \"count = (\\<Sum>(i, j, k) \\<in> {1..5} \\<times> {1..5} \\<times> {1..5}. if triangle_positive_area (i, j, k) then 1 else 0)\"\nand h1 : \"triangle_positive_area = (\\<lambda> (i, j, k). \\<exists> x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3 :: int.\n          (i, j, k) = (x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3) \\<and> x1 \\<in> {1..5} \\<and> y1 \\<in> {1..5} \\<and> x2 \\<in> {1..5} \\<and> y2 \\<in> {1..5} \\<and> x3 \\<in> {1..5} \\<and> y3 \\<in> {1..5} \\<and> ((x2 - x1) * (y3 - y1) - (x3 - x1) * (y2 - y1)) \\<noteq> 0)\"\nshows  \"count = 2148\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
