        "informal problem": "In a sequence of 15 coin tosses, each toss can result in four possible outcomes: two heads (HH), a head followed by a tail (HT), a tail followed by a head (TH), or two tails (TT). The score of a sequence is calculated as follows: 2 times the number of HH outcomes, 3 times the number of HT outcomes, 4 times the number of TH outcomes, and 5 times the number of TT outcomes. How many different scores are possible for a 15-toss sequence? The final answer is 560."
