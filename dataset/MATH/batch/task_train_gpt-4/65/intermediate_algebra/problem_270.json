How many polynomials are in $G$? The final Answer is 528\n ### Proof\n Since the coefficients of the polynomial are real numbers, any nonreal roots must come in conjugate pairs.\n Thus, when we factor $P(z)$ over the integers, each factor is either of the form $z - c,$ where $c$ is an integer, or \\[(z - a - bi)(z - a + bi) = z^2 - 2az + a^2 + b^2,\\]where $a$ and $b$ are integers, and $b \\neq 0.$  Furthermore, the product of the constant terms must be 50, so for each linear factor, $c$ divides 50, and for each quadratic factor, $a^2 + b^2$ divides 50.\n We call these linear and quadratic factors basic factors. For each divisor $d$ of 50, so $d \\in \\{1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50\\},$ let $B_d$ be the set of basic factors where the constant term is $\\pm d.$ For $d = 1,$ any basic quadratic factor must satisfy\n \\[a^2 + b^2 = 1.\\]The only solution is $(a,b) = (0, \\pm 1),$ which leads to the quadratic factor $z^2 + 1.$  We also have the linear factors $z \\pm 1.$  Hence, $|B_1| = 3.$ For $d = 2,$ any basic quadratic factor must satisfy\n \\[a^2 + b^2 = 2.\\]The solutions are $(a,b) = (\\pm 1, \\pm 1),$ which leads to the quadratic factors $z^2 - 2z + 2$ and $z^2 + 2z + 2.$  We also have the linear factors $z \\pm 2.$  Hence, $|B_2| = 4.$ For $d = 5,$ the solutions to\n \\[a^2 + b^2 = 5\\]are $(a,b) = (\\pm 1, \\pm 2)$ and $(\\pm 2, \\pm 1),$ so $|B_5| = 6.$ For $d = 10,$ the solutions to \\[a^2 + b^2 = 10\\]are $(a,b) = (\\pm 1, \\pm 3)$ and $(\\pm 3, \\pm 1),$ so $|B_{10}| = 6.$\n For $d = 25,$ the solutions to \\[a^2 + b^2 = 25\\]are $(a,b) = (\\pm 3, \\pm 4),$ $(\\pm 4, \\pm 3),$ and $(0, \\pm 5),$ so $|B_{25}| = 7.$ For $d = 50,$ the solutions to \\[a^2 + b^2 = 50\\]are $(a,b) = (\\pm 1, \\pm 7),$ $(\\pm 5, \\pm 5),$ and $(\\pm 7, \\pm 1),$ so $|B_{50}| = 8.$\n Now, consider the factors of $P(z)$ which belong in $B_d,$ where $d > 1.$  We have the following cases: $\\bullet$ There is one factor in $B_{50}.$ $\\bullet$ There is one factor in $B_2,$ and one factor in $B_{25}.$\n $\\bullet$ There is one factor in $B_5,$ and one factor in $B_{10}.$ $\\bullet$ There is one factors in $B_2,$ and two factors in $B_5.$ Case 1: There is one factor in $B_{50}.$ There are 8 ways to choose the factor in $B_{50}.$\n Case 2: There is one factor in $B_2,$ and one factor in $B_{25}.$ There are 4 ways to choose the factor in $B_2,$ and 7 ways to choose the factor in $B_{25}.$ Case 3: There is one factor in $B_5,$ and one factor in $B_{10}.$\n There are 6 ways to choose the factor in $B_5,$ and 6 ways to choose the factor in $B_{10}.$ Case 4: There is one factors in $B_2,$ and two factors in $B_5.$ There are 4 ways to choose the factor in $B_2,$ and $\\binom{6}{2}$ ways to choose the two factors in $B_5.$\n Hence, there are \\[8 + 4 \\cdot 7 + 6 \\cdot 6 + 4 \\binom{6}{2} = 132\\]ways to choose the factors in $B_d,$ where $d > 1.$ After we have chosen these factors, we can include $z + 1$ or $z^2 + 1$ arbitrarily.\n Finally, the constant coefficient is either 50 or $-50$ at this point. If the coefficient is 50, then we cannot include $z - 1.$  If the constant coefficient is $-50,$ then we must include $z - 1.$  Thus, whether we include $z - 1$ or not is uniquely determined.\n Therefore, the total number of polynomials in $G$ is $132 \\cdot 2^2 = \\boxed{528}.$\n *)\n\nDue to the nature of the problem, it cannot be directly translated into a theorem in Isabelle, because it involves counting a set of polynomials with certain properties, which is a computational problem and not a logical proposition.
