The final Answer is (1,-2)\n ### Proof\n Note that the lines $4x - 3y = 30$ and $4x - 3y = -10$ are parallel, so the center of the circle lies on the line which is exactly halfway between these lines, which is $4x - 3y = 10.$ [asy] unitsize(2 cm);\n pair A, B; A = dir(-20); B = dir(160); draw(Circle((0,0),1)); draw((A + 1.5*dir(70))--(A - 1.5*dir(70))); draw((B + 1.5*dir(70))--(B - 1.5*dir(70))); draw((1.5*dir(70))--(-1.5*dir(70)),dashed); label(\"$4x - 3y = -10$\", B + 1.5*dir(70), N);\n label(\"$4x - 3y = 30$\", A + 1.5*dir(70), N); label(\"$4x - 3y = 10$\", -1.5*dir(70), S); dot((0,0)); [/asy]\n Solving the system $2x + y = 0$ and $4x - 3y = 10,$ we find $x = 1$ and $y = -2.$  Therefore, the center of the circle is $\\boxed{(1,-2)}.$\n *)\n\ntheorem \nfixes x y :: real \nassumes h0 : \"4 * x - 3 * y = 30\"\nand h1 : \"4 * x - 3 * y = -10\"\nand h2 : \"2 * x + y = 0\"\nand h3 : \"dist ((x, y), (4 * x - 3 * y, 2 * x + y)) = dist ((x, y), (4 * x - 3 * y, -10))\"\nshows  \"(x, y) = (1, -2)\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
