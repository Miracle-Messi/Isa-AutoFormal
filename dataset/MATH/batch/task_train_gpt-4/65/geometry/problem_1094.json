The interior angles of a regular hexagon are 120 degrees and the interior angles of a square are 90 degrees.\n Thus, $m\\angle BDC=m \\angle BDE - m\\angle CDE=120^\\circ - 90^\\circ = 30^\\circ$. In addition, because the square and regular hexagon share a side and all of their sides have the same length, segments $CD$ and $BD$ have the same length.\n Thus, triangle $BCD$ is isosceles. Because the base angles of an isosceles triangle are congruent, $m\\angle BCD = m \\angle CBD=x$. In addition, because the interior angles of a triangle sum to 180 degrees, we have  \\begin{align}\n 180^\\circ &= m\\angle BDC+m\\angle BCD + m\\angle CBD \\\\ &=30^\\circ + x + x \\\\ 150^\\circ &= 2x \\\\ 75^\\circ = x \\end{align} Thus, $m\\angle CBD=75^\\circ$.
