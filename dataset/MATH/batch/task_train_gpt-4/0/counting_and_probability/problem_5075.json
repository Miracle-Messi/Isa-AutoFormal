If a sequence ends in an $A$, then it must have been formed by appending two $A$s to the end of a string of length $n-2$.\n If a sequence ends in a $B,$ it must have either been formed by appending one $B$ to a string of length $n-1$ ending in an $A$, or by appending two $B$s to a string of length $n-2$ ending in a $B$.\n Thus, we have the recursions\\begin{align} a_n &= a_{n-2} + b_{n-2}\\\\ b_n &= a_{n-1} + b_{n-2}  \\end{align}By counting, we find that $a_1 = 0, b_1 = 1, a_2 = 1, b_2 = 0$.\\[\\begin{array}{|r||r|r|||r||r|r|} \\hline n & a_n & b_n & n & a_n & b_n\\\\ \\hline 1&0&1& 8&6&10\\\\ 2&1&0& 9&11&11\\\\ 3&1&2& 10&16&21\\\\ 4&1&1& 11&22&27\\\\ 5&3&3& 12&37&43\\\\ 6&2&4& 13&49&64\\\\ 7&6&5& 14&80&92\\\\ \\hline \\end{array}\\]Therefore, the number of such strings of length $14$ is $a_{14} + b_{14} = \\boxed{172}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes n :: nat and seq :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> nat\"\nassumes h0 : \"n = 14\"\nand h1 : \"valid_seq seq\"\nand h2 : \"\\<forall> i. valid_seq (\\<lambda> i.
