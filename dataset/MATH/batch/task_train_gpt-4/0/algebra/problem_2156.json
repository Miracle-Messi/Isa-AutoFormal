The final Answer is \\frac{1}{6}\n ### Proof\n Let $d$ be the distance from Bill to the center of the Earth and $f$ be the gravitational force that the Earth exerts on him. Since $f$ is inversely proportional to $d^2$, $f\\cdot d^2=k$ for some constant $k$.\n Since the force when Bill is on the surface of Earth is 600 Newtons, $k=600\\cdot4000^2=9,\\!600,\\!000,000$.\n Therefore, if we let $x$ be the force that the Earth acts on  Bill with when he is on the Moon, $x\\cdot240,\\!000^2=960,\\!000,\\!000$ so $x=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{6}}$. Alternatively, the distance between Bill and the center of the Earth has been increased by a factor of 60, so the force has to be decreased by a factor of $60^2=3600$.\n Since $\\frac{600}{3600}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$, we get the same answer.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes F1 F2 r1 r2 k :: real\nassumes h0 : \"F1 = 600\"\nand h1 : \"r1 = 4000\"\nand h2 : \"r2 = 240000\"\nand h3 : \"F1 * r1 powr 2 = k\"\nand h4 : \"F2 * r2 powr 2 = k\"\nshows  \"F2 = 1 / 6\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "Two planets have gravitational forces F1 and F2, and their distances from a space object are r1 and r2, respectively. If F1 = 600 N and r1 = 4,000 m, and r2 = 240,000 m, find the gravitational force F2, assuming the force is proportional to the square of the distance. The final answer is F2 = $\\frac{1}{6}$ N."
