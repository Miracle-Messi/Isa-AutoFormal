Since $m\\parallel n$, we have $\\angle 5 = \\angle 1 = x$. Since $\\angle 2$ and $\\angle 5$ together form a straight line, we have $\\angle 2 + \\angle 5 = 180^\\circ$, so $x+8x=180^\\circ$.\n This gives us $9x = 180^\\circ$, so $x= \\boxed{20^\\circ}$.\n *)\n\nThis theorem is not well-suited for translation to Isabelle. Isabelle is a theorem prover intended for formal verification of mathematical and logical statements. The given problem is a geometry problem that involves visual interpretation of a diagram, which Isabelle is not equipped to handle. Therefore, it is not possible to translate this problem into a theorem in Isabelle.\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",

Thus, there is no mathematical problem to translate into natural language."
