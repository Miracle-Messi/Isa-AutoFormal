Each of these three parts of the trip is made entirely by bus or entirely by airplane.  The cities form a right-angled triangle as shown, with $C$ a distance of 3000 km from $A$ and with $B$ a distance of 3250 km from $A$. To take a bus, it costs Piravena $\\$0.15$ per kilometer. To take an airplane, it costs her a $\\$100$ booking fee, plus $\\$0.10$ per kilometer.

The final Answer is 7500\n ### Proof\n Since $\\triangle ABC$ is a right-angled triangle, then we may use the Pythagorean Theorem.\n Thus, $AB^2=BC^2+CA^2$, and so  \\begin{align} BC^2&=AB^2-CA^2\\\\ &=3250^2-3000^2\\\\ &=250^2(13^2-12^2)\\\\ &=250^2(5^2)\\\\ &=1250^2. \\end{align} therefore $BC=1250$ km (since $BC>0$). Piravena travels a distance of $3250+1250+3000=\\boxed{7500}$ km for her complete trip.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes A B C :: real\nassumes h0 : \"A = 3000\"\nand h1 : \"B = 3250\"\nand h2 : \"C = sqrt (B powr 2 - A powr 2)\"\nshows  \"A + B + C = 7500\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "Calculate the sum of $A$, $B$, and $C$ where $A = 3000$, $B = 3250$ and $C$ is the square root of $B^2 - A^2$. The final answer is $7500$."
