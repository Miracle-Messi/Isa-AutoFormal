Three of them are chosen - all choices being equally likely - and are sent off to slay a troublesome dragon. Let $P$ be the probability that at least two of the three had been sitting next to each other. If $P$ is written as a fraction in lowest terms, what is the sum of the numerator and denominator?\n The final Answer is 57\n ### Proof\n We can use complementary counting, by finding the probability that none of the three knights are sitting next to each other and subtracting it from $1$. Imagine that the $22$ other (indistinguishable) people are already seated, and fixed into place.\n We will place $A$, $B$, and $C$ with and without the restriction. There are $22$ places to put $A$, followed by $21$ places to put $B$, and $20$ places to put $C$ after $A$ and $B$.\n Hence, there are $22\\cdot21\\cdot20$ ways to place $A, B, C$ in between these people with restrictions. Without restrictions, there are $22$ places to put $A$, followed by $23$ places to put $B$, and $24$ places to put $C$ after $A$ and $B$.\n Hence, there are $22\\cdot23\\cdot24$ ways to place $A,B,C$ in between these people without restrictions.\n Thus, the desired probability is $1-\\frac{22\\cdot21\\cdot20}{22\\cdot23\\cdot24}=1-\\frac{420}{552}=1-\\frac{35}{46}=\\frac{11}{46}$, and the answer is $11+46=\\boxed{57}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes knights :: nat and P :: real\nassumes h0 : \"knights = 25\"\nand h1 : \"P = (\\<Sum>k=1..25.

        "informal problem": "A group of 25 knights is seated in a circle. Each knight has two neighbors, one on the left and one on the right. The product of the numbers of the knights' neighbors is $(3k-1)$ for the $k$-th knight. Calculate the sum of all fractions $\\frac{(3k-1)}{(25\\cdot24)}$ for $k=1$ to $25$. Express the answer as a simplified fraction and find the sum of the numerator and the denominator. The final answer is $57$."
