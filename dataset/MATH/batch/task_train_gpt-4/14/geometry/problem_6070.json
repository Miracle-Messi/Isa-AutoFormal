        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n The perimeter of triangle $APM$ is $152$, and the angle $PAM$ is a right angle. A circle of radius $19$ with center $O$ on $\\overline{AP}$ is drawn so that it is tangent to $\\overline{AM}$ and $\\overline{PM}$. Given that $OP=m/n$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, find $m+n$.\n The final Answer is 98\n ### Proof\n Let the circle intersect $\\overline{PM}$ at $B$. Then note $\\triangle OPB$ and $\\triangle MPA$ are similar. Also note that $AM = BM$ by power of a point.\n Using the fact that the ratio of corresponding sides in similar triangles is equal to the ratio of their perimeters, we have\\[\\frac{19}{AM} = \\frac{152-2AM-19+19}{152} = \\frac{152-2AM}{152}\\]Solving, $AM = 38$.\n So the ratio of the side lengths of the triangles is 2.\n Therefore,\\[\\frac{PB+38}{OP}= 2 \\text{ and } \\frac{OP+19}{PB} = 2\\]so $2OP = PB+38$ and $2PB = OP+19.$ Substituting for $PB$, we see that $4OP-76 = OP+19$, so $OP = \\frac{95}3$ and the answer is $\\boxed{98}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes A P M O :: complex and r :: real\nassumes h0 : \"A \\<noteq> P\"\nand h1 : \"A \\<noteq> M\"\nand h2 : \"P \\<noteq> M\"\nand h3 : \"dist A P + dist P M + dist M A = 152\"\nand h4 : \"arg (M - A) - arg (P - A) = pi / 2\"\nand h5 : \"r = 19\"\nand h6 : \"O \\<in> closed_segment A P\"\nand h7 : \"dist O M = r\"\nand h8 : \"dist O (line_of A M) = r\"\nshows  \"let m = numerator (to_rational (dist O P));\n           n = denominator (to_rational (dist O P))\n       in gcd m n = 1 \\<and> m + n = 98\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
