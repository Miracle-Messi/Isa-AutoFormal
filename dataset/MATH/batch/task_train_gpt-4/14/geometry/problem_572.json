This leads to the set $\\{1,7,7\\}$. Case 2:  shortest side has length $2$. Then the other two sides must have lengths $6$ and $7$.\n This leads to the set $\\{2,6,7\\}$. Case 3:  shortest side has length $3$. Then the other two sides can have lengths $6$ and $6$ or $5$ and $7$. This leads to the sets $\\{3,6,6\\}$ and $\\{3,5,7\\}$. Case 4:  shortest side has length $4$.\n Then the other two sides can have lengths $5$ and $6$ or $4$ and $7$. This leads to the sets $\\{4,5,6\\}$ and $\\{4,4,7\\}$. Case 5:  shortest side has length $5$. Then the other two sides must have lengths $5$ and $5$.\n This leads to the set $\\{5,5,5\\}$.\n Hence there are $\\boxed{7}$ sets of non-congruent triangles with a perimeter of $15$ units.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes a b c :: int\nassumes h0 : \"a + b + c = 15\"\nand h1 : \"a > 0\"\nand h2 : \"b > 0\"\nand h3 : \"c > 0\"\nand h4 : \"a + b > c\"\nand h5 : \"a + c > b\"\nand h6 : \"b + c > a\"\nshows  \"card { (a, b, c) | a b c. a + b + c = 15 \\<and> a > 0 \\<and> b > 0 \\<and> c > 0 \\<and> a + b > c \\<and> a + c > b \\<and> b + c > a } = 7\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "How many sets of positive integers $(a, b, c)$ are there such that $a + b + c = 15$ and the values can form the sides of a triangle (i.e., $a + b > c$, $a + c > b$, and $b + c > a$)? The final answer is 7."
