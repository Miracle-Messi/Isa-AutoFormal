        "informal problem": "Suppose sets A and B are finite and disjoint, meaning they have no elements in common. Their union forms the set of all integers from 1 to 12 inclusive. Additionally, the number of elements in set A is not an element of A, and the number of elements in set B is not an element of B. What is the value of N? The final answer is 772."
