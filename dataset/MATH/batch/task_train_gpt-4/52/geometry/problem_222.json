The area of that box is $4 \\times 8 = 32$ square units.\n From that we can subtract the area of the sectors of the 2 circles that are binding our shaded region. The area of each sector is $(1/4)4^2\\pi = 4\\pi$; therefore, we need to subtract $2(4\\pi) = 8\\pi$. This gives us $\\boxed{32 - 8\\pi}$ square units.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes pi :: real\nassumes h0 : \"pi = 3.141592653589793\"\nand h1 : \"\\<forall> r. area_circle r = pi * r powr 2\"\nand h2 : \"area_rectangle 4 8 = 32\"\nand h3 : \"area_circle 4 = pi * 4 powr 2\"\nshows  \"area_gray = area_rectangle 4 8 - 2 * area_circle 4\"\nand \"area_gray = 32 - 8 * pi\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "Given that the value of pi is approximately 3.141592653589793, the formula for the area of a circle is $\u03c0r^2$, the area of a rectangle with length 4 and width 8 is 32, and the area of a circle with radius 4 is $\u03c04^2$. Find the area of the shaded region, which is the area of the rectangle subtracted by twice the area of the circle. The final answer is $32 - 8\u03c0$."
