        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n Matt will arrange four identical, dotless dominoes (shaded 1 by 2 rectangles) on the 5 by 4 grid below so that a path is formed from the upper left-hand corner $A$ to the lower righthand corner $B$. In a path, consecutive dominoes must touch at their sides and not just their corners. No domino may be placed diagonally; each domino covers exactly two of the unit squares shown on the grid. One arrangement is shown. How many distinct arrangements are possible, including the one shown?\n\n[asy]\nsize(101);\nreal w = 1; picture q;\nfilldraw(q,(1/10,0)--(19/10,0)..(2,1/10)--(2,9/10)..(19/10,1)--(1/10,1)..(0,9/10)--(0,1/10)..cycle,gray(.6),linewidth(.6));\nadd(shift(4*up)*q); add(shift(3*up)*shift(3*right)*rotate(90)*q); add(shift(1*up)*shift(3*right)*rotate(90)*q); add(shift(4*right)*rotate(90)*q);\npair A = (0,5); pair B = (4,0);\nfor(int i = 0; i<5; ++i)\n{draw((i,0)--(A+(i,0))); draw((0,i)--(B+(0,i)));}\ndraw(A--(A+B));\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW,fontsize(8pt)); label(\"$B$\",B,SE,fontsize(8pt));\n[/asy] The final Answer is 35\n ### Proof\n The shortest possible path from $A$ to $B$ requires $4$ dominoes, which is all we have, so we must use them to make only down and right movements - we have none to waste going up or left.\n We need to make $3$ movements to the right and $4$ down, and we can arrange them however we wish.\n So there are $$\\binom{7}{3}=\\boxed{35}$$arrangements. It is easy to see that each domino arrangement is one of the path mentioned above.\n To show every above mentioned path can be paved by the dominoes, color the table cells white and black alternatively. Then each path must also be white and black alternatively, thus can always be paved by the dominoes.\n *)\n\n(* Note: This problem requires a more complex setup and cannot be directly translated to Isabelle. *)\n(* However, we can define some basic concepts and setup, which can be used to represent the problem. *)\n\ntype_synonym point = \"int * int\"\ntype_synonym domino = \"point * point\"\ntype_synonym arrangement = \"domino list\"\n\ndefinition grid :: \"int \\<Rightarrow> int \\<Rightarrow> bool\"\nwhere\n\"grid x y = (x \\<ge> 0 \\<and> x < 4 \\<and> y \\<ge> 0 \\<and> y < 5)\"\n\ndefinition valid_domino :: \"domino \\<Rightarrow> bool\"\nwhere\n\"valid_domino d = (let (p1, p2) = d in\n                   grid (fst p1) (snd p1) \\<and>\n                   grid (fst p2) (snd p2) \\<and>\n                   (abs (fst p1 - fst p2) = 1 \\<and> snd p1 = snd p2 \\<or>\n                    abs (snd p1 - snd p2) = 1 \\<and> fst p1 = fst p2))\"\n\ndefinition valid_arrangement :: \"arrangement \\<Rightarrow> bool\"\nwhere\n\"valid_arrangement arr = (length arr = 4 \\<and> (\\<forall>d \\<in> set arr. valid_domino d) \\<and>\n                          distinct (concat (map (\\<lambda>d.

        "informal problem": "In a 4x5 grid, there are four dominoes placed horizontally. Each domino covers two adjacent cells. The dominoes are placed in such a way that the leftmost cells of the first row (row 0) are covered, i.e., the cells (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), and (0,3).
