There are a total of $10!$ ways in which the 10 songs can be ordered.\n If her favorite song is the first song, she obviously hears the whole thing, and then there are $9!$ ways to order the other songs. If the first song is the 30 second song, then she will hear the entirety of her favorite song if and only if it is played as the second song, after which there are $8!$ ways to order the other songs.\n Finally, if the first song is the 1 minute song, she will hear her favorite song if and only if it is played as the second song, after which there are $8!$ ways to order the other songs. If the first song is longer than a minute, or if two songs are played before her first song, she won't have time to hear all of her favorite song in the first 4 minutes, 30 seconds.\n So out of the $10!$ ways of ordering the 10 songs, there are $9! + 8! + 8!$ ways that result in her hearing the full song for a probability of $\\dfrac{9!+8!+8!}{10!}=\\dfrac{8!}{8!}\\cdot\\dfrac{9+1+1}{10\\cdot9}=\\dfrac{11}{90}$.\n But that is the probability that what we want $\\emph{doesn't}$ happen, so we need to subtract it from 1 to get our final probability of $1-\\dfrac{11}{90}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{79}{90}}$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes p :: \"real\"\nassumes h0 : \"0 < p \\<and> p \\<le> 1\"\nand h1 : \"p = 79 / 90\"\nshows  \"p = probability that Celeste hears the first 4 minutes 30 seconds of music without hearing every second of her favorite song\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
