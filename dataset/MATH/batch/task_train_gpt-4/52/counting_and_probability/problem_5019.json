What is the largest possible number of red socks in the drawer that is consistent with this data?\n The final Answer is 990\n ### Proof\n Let $r$ and $b$ denote the number of red and blue socks, respectively. Also, let $t=r+b$. The probability $P$ that when two socks are drawn randomly, without replacement, both are red or both are blue is given by\n \\[\\frac{r(r-1)}{(r+b)(r+b-1)}+\\frac{b(b-1)}{(r+b)(r+b-1)}=\\frac{r(r-1)+(t-r)(t-r-1)}{t(t-1)}=\\frac{1}{2}.\\]\n Solving the resulting quadratic equation $r^{2}-rt+t(t-1)/4=0$, for $r$ in terms of $t$, one obtains that \\[r=\\frac{t\\pm\\sqrt{t}}{2}\\, .\\]\n Now, since $r$ and $t$ are positive integers, it must be the case that $t=n^{2}$, with $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$.\n Hence, $r=n(n\\pm 1)/2$ would correspond to the general solution. For the present case $t\\leq 1991$, and so one easily finds that $n=44$ is the largest possible integer satisfying the problem conditions.\n In summary, the solution is that the maximum number of red socks is $r=\\boxed{990}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes red_socks blue_socks total_socks :: nat\nassumes h0 : \"total_socks \\<le> 1991\"\nand h1 : \"red_socks + blue_socks = total_socks\"\nand h2 : \"((red_socks * (red_socks - 1)) + (blue_socks * (blue_socks - 1))) / (total_socks * (total_socks - 1)) = 1 / 2\"\nshows  \"red_socks \\<le> 990\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
