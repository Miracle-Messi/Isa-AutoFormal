This is also the fourth number in the row, so the common difference in the row is $(6 - 21)/3 = -5$.\n Then the seventh (and last) number in the row is $21 - 5 \\cdot 6 = -9$. In the second column, the common difference is $[(-17) - (-9)]/4 = -2$, so $N = -9 - (-2) = \\boxed{-7}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes N :: int\nassumes h0 : \"N = 21 + 7 * n1\"\nand h1 : \"N = 14 + 4 * n2\"\nand h2 : \"N = -17 + 35 * n3\"\nshows  \"N = -7\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
