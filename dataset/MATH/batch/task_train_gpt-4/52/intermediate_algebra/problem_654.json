        "informal problem": "There are eight integers in a sequence such that each integer is between 2 and 7 inclusive. Each integer in the sequence is different from the next six integers that follow it in the sequence. Moreover, for any three consecutive integers in the sequence, their product equals the product of the next three integers. The product of the last three integers is 729. The sum of the products of every three consecutive integers in the sequence is less than or equal to 729. Determine the product of the sixth, seventh, and eighth integer in the sequence.
