        "informal problem": "Given two conditions, the first one being that for all $x$ and $y$, $x^2 + 5y^2 = 6$ and the second one being that for all $x$ and $y$, both $(x - r)^2 + y^2 = r^2$ and $(x + r)^2 + y^2 = r^2$ hold true, find the value of $r$. The final answer is $r = \\frac{2\\sqrt{6}}{5}$."
