You could also differentiate the tall oak trees from the short oak trees, and the maple trees with many branches as opposed to those with few branches.\n Indeed, you could keep dividing until you have them each in their own category, but in the end it will not change the probability of the birch trees being near each other. That is, in the end, you multiply the numerator by the number of ways to arrange the oak and maple trees and you also multiply the denominator by the number of ways to arrange the oak and maple trees, making them cancel out.)\n The five birch trees must be placed amongst the seven previous trees.\n We can think of these trees as 5 dividers of 8 slots that the birch trees can go in, making ${8\\choose5} = 56$ different ways to arrange this. There are ${12 \\choose 5} = 792$ total ways to arrange the twelve trees, so the probability is $\\frac{56}{792} = \\frac{7}{99}$.\n The answer is $7 + 99 = \\boxed{106}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes maple_trees oak_trees birch_trees :: nat\nassumes h0 : \"maple_trees = 3\"\nand h1 : \"oak_trees = 4\"\nand h2 : \"birch_trees = 5\"\nand h3 : \"count_space_size = fact (maple_trees + oak_trees + birch_trees)\"\nand h4 : \"success_space_size = fact (oak_trees + maple_trees + 1) * fact birch_trees\"\nand h5 : \"probability = (success_space_size :: rat) / count_space_size\"\nand h6 : \"lowest_terms = (\\<lambda>a b. gcd a b = 1)\"\nand h7 : \"m = numerator probability\"\nand h8 : \"n = denominator probability\"\nand h9 : \"h6 m n\"\nshows  \"m + n = 106\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "There are 3 maple trees, 4 oak trees, and 5 birch trees in a row. If you randomly rearrange the trees, what is the probability that no birch tree is next to another birch tree? Express your answer as a simplified fraction, and find the sum of the numerator and the denominator. The final answer is 106."
