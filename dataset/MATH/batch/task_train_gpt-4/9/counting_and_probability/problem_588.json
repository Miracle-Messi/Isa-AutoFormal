        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n The numbers from 1 to 150, inclusive, are placed in a bag and a number is randomly selected from the bag. What is the probability it is not a perfect power (integers that can be expressed as $x^{y}$ where $x$ is an integer and $y$ is an integer greater than 1. For example, $2^{4}=16$ is a perfect power, while $2\\times3=6$ is not a perfect power)? Express your answer as a common fraction. The final Answer is \\frac{133}{150}\n ### Proof\n It is easier to count the number of integers from 1 to 150 that are perfect powers.\n We see there are 12 perfect squares from 1 to 150, namely $1^{2}, 2^{2}, \\ldots, 12^{2}$, and there are 5 perfect cubes, namely $1^{3}, \\ldots, 5^{3}$. Notice all the perfect fourth powers are also perfect squares.\n Similarly, all the perfect sixth powers are also perfect squares. The only perfect powers not yet counted are $2^5=32$ and $2^7=128$. Then notice there are two repetitions, $1^{6} =1$ and $2^{6} = 64$ which we counted both as perfect squares and perfect cubes.\n So there is a total $12+5+1+1-2=17$ of integers from 1 to 150 that are perfect powers.\n Thus, $150-17=133$ integers are not perfect powers. The probability that we select such a number is $\\boxed{\\frac{133}{150}}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes n :: nat\nassumes h0 : \"n \\<in> {1..150}\"\nand h1 : \"\\<forall>x y. x > 0 \\<and> y > 1 \\<longrightarrow> (x powr y :: real) \\<notin> {1..150}\"\nshows  \"measure lborel {n \\<in> {1..150}. real n \\<notin> (\\<lambda>(x, y). x powr y) ` ({1..150} \\<times> {2..150})} = 133 / 150\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "Consider the set of all real numbers $x^y$, where $x$ and $y$ are positive integers greater than 0 and 1, respectively, and both are between 1 and 150. How many numbers from 1 to 150 (inclusive) cannot be expressed as $x^y$ under these conditions? The answer is $\\frac{133}{150}$."
