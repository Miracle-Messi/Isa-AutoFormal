Once the calculators have all gone around the circle and return to Dean so that everyone has had one turn, Dean adds up the numbers showing on the calculators. What is the sum he ends up with? The final Answer is 0\n ### Proof\n Let's begin with the calculator that initially shows 1. Each time it is passed around the circle, it is cubed. 1 to any power is still 1, so no matter how many times 1 is cubed, the final result will still be 1.\n Now examine the calculator that starts with a zero. 0 squared is still 0 because 0 to any positive power is still 0.\n Thus, no matter how many times zero is squared, the final number will still be zero. Finally, let's look at the calculator that initially shows -1. Each time a person gets the calculator, they negate the number.\n Because there are 42 participants, there are 42 total turns.\n Thus, -1 is negated 42 times. Because negating a number is the same as multiplying by -1, this is the same as multiplying it by -1 forty-two times.\n Thus, we are looking for \\[(-1) \\cdot (-1)^{42}=(-1)^1 \\cdot (-1)^{42}=(-1)^{1+42}=(-1)^{43}.\\]Recall that $(-a)^n=-a^n$ if $n$ is odd. Because 43 is odd, $(-1)^{43}=-1^{43}=-1$.\n Thus, the sum of all of the numbers is $1+0+(-1)=\\boxed{0}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes calculator1 calculator2 calculator3 :: real\nassumes h0 : \"calculator1 = 1\"\nand h1 : \"calculator2 = 0\"\nand h2 : \"calculator3 = -1\"\nand h3 : \"\\<forall> n \\<in> {1..42}. calculator1 = (calculator1 ^ 3) \\<and> calculator2 = (calculator2 ^ 2) \\<and> calculator3 = -calculator3\"\nshows  \"calculator1 + calculator2 + calculator3 = 0\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "Assume there are three calculators. The first calculator is initially set to 1, the second to 0, and the third to -1. If each calculator is set to perform a certain operation 42 times (the first calculator cubes its current value, the second squares its current value, and the third negates its current value), what is the sum of the values in the three calculators after these operations?
