Note, however, that if either $N$ or $N-1$ has both a $5$ and a $2$ in its factorization, the other must end in either $1$ or $9$, which is impossible for a number that is divisible by either $2$ or $5$.\n Thus, one of them is divisible by $2^4 = 16$, and the other is divisible by $5^4 = 625$. Noting that $625 \\equiv 1\\mod{16}$, we see that $625$ would work for $N$, except the thousands digit is $0$. The other possibility is that $N$ is a multiple of $16$ and $N-1$ is a multiple of $625$.\n In order for this to happen,\\[N-1 \\equiv -1 \\pmod {16}.\\]Since $625 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$, we know that $15 \\cdot 625 = 9375 \\equiv 15 \\equiv -1 \\mod{16}$.\n Thus, $N-1 = 9375$, so $N = 9376$, and our answer is $\\boxed{937}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes N :: int\nassumes h0 : \"N > 0\"\nand h1 : \"N mod 10000 = (N^2) mod 10000\"\nand h2 : \"N mod 10000 div 1000 \\<noteq> 0\"\nshows  \"N mod 1000 div 100 = 937\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
