The final Answer is \\frac{4}{11}\n ### Proof\n Since there were $20$ males last year, there are $1.05 \\cdot 20 =21$ males this year.\n We set the number of females last year as $x$. This means that there are $1.2x$ females this year. In total, there were $20+x$ people in the league last year, and $1.1 \\cdot (20+x)$ this year.\n We then have: \\begin{align} 22+1.1x &= 21+1.2x \\\\ 1 &= 0.1x \\\\ x &= 10. \\end{align} Therefore, there were $10$ girls last year. This means there are $1.2 \\cdot 10 =12$ girls this year.\n So there are $\\frac{12}{12+21}=\\frac{12}{33}=\\boxed{\\frac{4}{11}}$ girls out of the participants this year.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes last_year_males last_year_females :: real\nassumes h0 : \"last_year_males = 20\"\nand h1 : \"last_year_females > 0\"\nand h2 : \"0.1 * (last_year_males + last_year_females) = 0.05 * last_year_males + 0.2 * last_year_females\"\nshows  \"last_year_females / (last_year_males + last_year_females) = 4 / 11\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
