The distance between $A$ and $B$ can be written as $\\frac{\\sqrt{m}}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers that do not share any factors other than one. Find the value of $m - n$. The final Answer is 61\n ### Proof\n In order for the graphs of $y=3$ and $y=4x^2 + x -1$ to intersect, we must have $3 = 4x^2 + x - 1$, so $4x^2 + x - 4 = 0$.\n By the quadratic formula, if $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, then $$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a};$$the (positive) difference of these two roots is given by $\\left|\\frac{\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{a}\\right|$. Since $A$ and $B$ lie on a horizontal line, it follows that this difference is the distance $AB$.\n Substituting the given values, we have that the answer is $\\left|\\frac{\\sqrt{1^2-4(4)(-4)}}{4}\\right| = \\frac{\\sqrt{65}}{4}$.\n Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{61}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes x_A x_B y_A y_B m n :: real\nassumes h0 : \"y_A = 3\"\nand h1 : \"y_B = 3\"\nand h2 : \"y_A = 4 * x_A powr 2 + x_A - 1\"\nand h3 : \"y_B = 4 * x_B powr 2 + x_B - 1\"\nand h4 : \"sqrt m / n = sqrt ((x_B - x_A) powr 2 + (y_B - y_A) powr 2)\"\nand h5 : \"coprime m n\"\nshows  \"m - n = 61\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
