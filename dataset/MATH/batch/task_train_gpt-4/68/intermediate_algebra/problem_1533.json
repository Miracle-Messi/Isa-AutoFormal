        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n Consider all polynomials of the form\n\\[x^9 + a_8 x^8 + a_7 x^7 + \\dots + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0,\\]where $a_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$ for all $0 \\le i \\le 8.$  Find the number of such polynomials that have exactly two different integer roots. The final Answer is 56\n ### Proof\n If all the $a_i$ are equal to 0, then the polynomial becomes $x^9 = 0,$ which has only one integer root, namely $x = 0.$  Thus, we can assume that there is some coefficient $a_i$ that is non-zero.\n Let $k$ be the smallest integer such that $a_k \\neq 0$; then we can take out a factor of $x^k,$ to get \\[x^k (x^{9 - k} + a_8 x^{8 - k} + a_7 x^{7 - k} + \\dots + a_{k + 1} x + a_k) = 0.\\]By the Integer Root Theorem, any integer root of $x^{9 - k} + a_8 x^{8 - k} + \\dots + a_{k + 1} x + a_k = 0$ must divide $a_k = 1,$ so the only possible integer roots are 1 and $-1.$ However, if we plug in $x = 1,$ we see that $x^{9 - k} = 1,$ and all the other terms are nonnegative, so $x = 1$ cannot be a root.\n Therefore, for the original polynomial to have two different integer roots, they must be 0 and $-1.$  For 0 to be a root, it suffices to take $a_0 = 0,$ and the polynomial is \\[x^9 + a_8 x^8 + a_7 x^7 + a_6 x^6 + a_5 x^5 + a_4 x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x = 0.\\]We also want $x = -1$ to be a root.\n We have that $(-1)^9 = -1,$ so in order for the polynomial to become 0 at $x = -1,$ we must choose some of the $a_i$ to be equal to 1. Specifically, if $k$ is the number of $i$ such that $a_i = 1$ and $i$ is odd, then the number of $i$ such that $a_i = 1$ and $i$ is even must be $k + 1.$\n There are four indices that are odd (1, 3, 5, 7), and four indices that are even (2, 4, 6, 8), so the possible values of $k$ are 0, 1, 2, and 3. Furthermore, for each $k,$ so the number of ways to choose $k$ odd indices and $k + 1$ even indices is $\\binom{4}{k} \\binom{4}{k + 1}.$  Therefore, the number of such polynomials is\n \\[\\binom{4}{0} \\binom{4}{1} + \\binom{4}{1} \\binom{4}{2} + \\binom{4}{2} \\binom{4}{3} + \\binom{4}{3} \\binom{4}{4} = \\boxed{56}.\\]\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes a :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> nat\" and p :: \"int \\<Rightarrow> int\"\nassumes h0 : \"\\<forall> i. i \\<in> {0..8} \\<longrightarrow> a i \\<in> {0, 1}\"\nand h1 : \"\\<forall> x. p x = x powr 9 + (\\<Sum> i \\<in> {0..8}. a i * x powr i)\"\nand h2 : \"card {x. p x = 0 \\<and> x \\<in> Ints} = 2\"\nshows  \"card {a. \\<forall> i. i \\<in> {0..8} \\<longrightarrow> a i \\<in> {0, 1} \\<and> \n               (\\<exists> p.

Now, for every integer $x$, consider a polynomial $p(x)$ of degree $9$ that is defined as $p(x) = x^9 + \\sum_{i=0}^{8} a(i)x^i$. We know that the equation $p(x) = 0$ has exactly $2$ solutions in the set of integers. The problem is to find the number of functions $a$ that satisfy these conditions. The final answer is $56$."
