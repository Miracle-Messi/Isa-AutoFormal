It is explaining that Isabelle does not support diagrams or figures directly, and problems involving these must be translated into a symbolic or numerical form that can be expressed in Isabelle's formal language. \n\nAn example is given of a problem involving the calculation of a value in a certain position of a specific number wall. It is highlighted that this type of problem is not a mathematical theorem or proof and thus does not have a direct translation into Isabelle's formal language. \n\nHowever, the text suggests that a similar problem could be formalized in Isabelle if the number wall is considered as a specific type of number sequence or function, but this would require a more precise mathematical definition or description of the problem."
