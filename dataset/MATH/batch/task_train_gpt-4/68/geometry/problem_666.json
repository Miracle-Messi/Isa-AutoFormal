        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n In the figure, circle $O$ has radius 6 units. Chord $CD$ has length 8 units and is parallel to segment $KB$. If $KA$ = 12 units and points $K$, $A$, $O$ and $B$ are collinear, what is the area of triangle $KDC$? Express your answer in simplest radical form. [asy]\ndraw(Circle((0,0),6));\ndot((0,0));\nlabel(\"$O$\",(0,0),S);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(-6,0),SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(6,0),SE);\nlabel(\"$K$\",(-18,0),W);\ndraw((-18,0)--(6,0));\nlabel(\"$C$\",(-4,sqrt(20)),NW);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(4,sqrt(20)),NE);\ndraw((-18,0)--(-4,sqrt(20)));\ndraw((-18,0)--(4,sqrt(20)));\ndraw((-4,sqrt(20))--(4,sqrt(20)));\n[/asy] The final Answer is 8\\sqrt{5}\n ### Proof\n The center of the circle, $O$, is the midpoint of the chord $AB$ (the diameter of the circle). Since we are told that $CD$ is parallel to $AB$, if we draw a line that is perpendicular to $AB$, it will be perpendicular to $CD$ as well.\n Now let's draw a segment from $O$ to the midpoint of the chord $CD$, which we will call $X$, and another segment from $O$ to $D$.\n Now we have right triangle $OXD$ as shown:   [asy] draw(Circle((0,0),6)); dot((0,0)); label(\"$O$\",(0,0),S); label(\"$A$\",(-6,0),SW); label(\"$B$\",(6,0),SE); label(\"$K$\",(-18,0),W); draw((-18,0)--(6,0)); label(\"$C$\",(-4,sqrt(20)),NW);\n label(\"$D$\",(4,sqrt(20)),NE); draw((-18,0)--(-4,sqrt(20))); draw((-18,0)--(4,sqrt(20))); draw((-4,sqrt(20))--(4,sqrt(20))); draw((0,0)--(0,sqrt(20)),linetype(\"8 8\")); draw((0,0)--(4,sqrt(20)),linetype(\"8 8\"));\n label(\"$X$\",(0,6),N); [/asy] We are told that chord $CD$ is 8 units long. Since $X$ is the midpoint of chord $CD$, both $CX$ and $XD$ must be 4 units long.\n We are also told that circle $O$ has a radius of 6 units. This means that $OD$ must be 6 units long. Because we have a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of $OX$.\n We get  \\begin{align} OX^{2}+XD^{2}&=OD^{2}\\\\ OX^{2}&=OD^{2}-XD^{2}\\\\ OX&=\\sqrt{OD^{2}-XD^{2}}\\\\ OX&=\\sqrt{6^2-4^2}\\\\ OX&=\\sqrt{20}. \\end{align} Now let's draw a segment from $D$ to a point $Y$ on segment $KA$ that is perpendicular to both $CD$ and $KA$.\n We get $DY$, drawn in red in the following diagram:  [asy] draw(Circle((0,0),6)); dot((0,0)); label(\"$O$\",(0,0),S); label(\"$A$\",(-6,0),SW); label(\"$B$\",(6,0),SE); label(\"$K$\",(-18,0),W); draw((-18,0)--(6,0));\n label(\"$C$\",(-4,sqrt(20)),NW); label(\"$D$\",(4,sqrt(20)),NE); draw((-18,0)--(-4,sqrt(20))); draw((-18,0)--(4,sqrt(20))); draw((-4,sqrt(20))--(4,sqrt(20))); draw((0,0)--(0,sqrt(20)),linetype(\"8 8\")); draw((0,0)--(4,sqrt(20)),linetype(\"8 8\"));\n label(\"$X$\",(0,6),N); draw((4,sqrt(20))--(4,0),rgb(1,0,0)); label(\"$Y$\",(4,0),S); [/asy] Since $DY$ forms right triangle $DYO$, which is congruent to $\\triangle OXD$, we get that $DY$ is $\\sqrt{20}$ units long.\n Now we can use the formula for a triangle, $\\mbox{area}=\\frac{1}{2}\\mbox{base}\\cdot\\mbox{height}$ to get the area of $\\triangle KDC$.\n We get  \\begin{align} \\mbox{area}&=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot8\\cdot\\sqrt{20}\\\\ &=4\\cdot\\sqrt{20}\\\\ &=4\\cdot2\\sqrt{5}\\\\ &=\\boxed{8\\sqrt{5}}. \\end{align}\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes O C D K :: \"real*real\" and r :: real\nassumes h0 : \"r = 6\"\nand h1 : \"dist C D = 8\"\nand h2 : \"KA = 12\"\nand h3 : \"collinear {K, A, O, B}\"\nshows  \"area (triangle KDC) = 8 * sqrt 5\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
