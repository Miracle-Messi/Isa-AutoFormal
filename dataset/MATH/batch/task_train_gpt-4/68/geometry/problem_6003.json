        "informal problem": "Given a circle with a radius $r$ that measures $\\sqrt{50}$ and two points A and B on the circle such that the distance AB is 6 and the distance BC is 2. If the distance between any two points A and B is given by $\\sqrt{(x_A - x_B)^2 + (y_A - y_B)^2}$, find the distance from point B to the center of the circle. The final answer is $\\sqrt{26}$."
