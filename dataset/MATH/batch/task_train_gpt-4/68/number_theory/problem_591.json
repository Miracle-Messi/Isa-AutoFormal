But the right side is even and $21$ is odd, so there are no $b$ which satisfy this and thus no numbers with $a=2b$.\n If $b=2a$, again we substitute to find $2a^2\\mid 10a+2a$, or $2a^2\\mid 12a$. This means $12a=n(2a^2)$ for some integer $n$, or $6=na$, so $a$ must be a divisor of $6$.\n Thus $a$ can be $1,2,3$, or $6$. The corresponding values of $b$ are $2,4,6$ and $12$. But $b\\le 9$, so the pair $(6,12)$ must be thrown out and we have three possible pairs for $(a,b)$: $(1,2)$, $(2,4)$, and $(3,6)$.\n These correspond to the numbers $12, 24$, and $36$, and the sum is $12+24+36=\\boxed{72}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes sum :: int and product :: int\nassumes h0 : \"\\<forall> n. n \\<ge> 10 \\<and> n \\<le> 99 \\<longrightarrow> \n  (let sum = n div 10 + n mod 10; product = (n div 10) * (n mod 10) in \n  n mod sum = 0 \\<and> n mod product = 0)\"\nshows  \"sum {n. n \\<ge> 10 \\<and> n \\<le> 99 \\<and> n mod (n div 10 + n mod 10) = 0 \\<and> n mod ((n div 10) * (n mod 10)) = 0} = 72\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
