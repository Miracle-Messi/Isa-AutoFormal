How many cases of measles would have been reported in 1987 if the number of cases reported from 1960 to 1996 decreased linearly? The final Answer is 112,\\!875\n ### Proof\n Over the course of $1996-1960=36$ years, the number of cases of measles decreased by $450,\\!000-500=449,\\!500$.\n So, over the course of $1987-1960=27$, the number of cases would decrease by $\\frac{27}{36}\\cdot(449,\\!500)=337,\\!125$ cases.\n Therefore, the number of cases in 1987 would be $450,\\!000-337,\\!125=\\boxed{112,\\!875}$ if the number of cases decreased linearly.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes measles_1960 measles_1996 :: int\nand linear_decrease :: \"int \\<Rightarrow> int\"\nassumes h0 : \"measles_1960 = 450000\"\nand h1 : \"measles_1996 = 500\"\nand h2 : \"\\<forall> year. year \\<ge> 1960 \\<and> year \\<le> 1996 \\<longrightarrow> linear_decrease year = measles_1960 - (year - 1960) * (measles_1960 - measles_1996) div (1996 - 1960)\"\nshows  \"linear_decrease 1987 = 112875\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "In 1960, there were 450,000 reported cases of measles. By 1996, the number of cases had dropped to 500. Assuming a linear decrease in the number of cases between 1960 and 1996, how many cases of measles were there in 1987? The final answer is 112,875."
