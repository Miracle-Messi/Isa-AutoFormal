        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n The arithmetic mean, geometric mean, and harmonic mean of $a$, $b$, $c$ are $8$, $5$, $3$ respectively. What is the value of $a^2+b^2+c^2$? The final Answer is 326\n ### Proof\n We start by trying to get as much information as possible from what is given to us about $a$, $b$, and $c$. Since their arithmetic mean is $8$, we know that $\\frac{a+b+c}{3} = 8$ which when we multiply both sides by $3$ gives us $a+b+c=24$.\n Since their geometric mean is $5$ we have $\\sqrt[3]{abc}=5$, which when we cube both sides gives us $abc = 125$.\n Now since the harmonic mean is $3$, we have $$\\frac{3}{\\frac{1}{a}+\\frac{1}{b}+\\frac{1}{c}}=3.$$We can simplify to get $$\\frac{1}{a}+\\frac{1}{b}+\\frac{1}{c} = 1.$$Converting to a common denominator gives\n $$\\frac{ab+bc+ca}{abc}=1$$which tells us that $ab+bc+ca=abc=125$.\n Now, we try and use this information to find $a^2+b^2+c^2$. Since we already know $a+b+c$, we can start by squaring that whole expression and expanding. This gives us, $$(a+b+c)^2=a^2+b^2+c^2+2(ab+bc+ca).$$We can rewrite the equation above as\n $$a^2+b^2+c^2=(a+b+c)^2-2(ab+bc+ca).$$Since we know both expressions on the right, we can substitute them in and solve to get $$a^2+b^2+c^2=(24)^2-2(125)=576-250=\\boxed{326}.$$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes a b c :: real\nassumes h0 : \"(a + b + c) / 3 = 8\"\nand h1 : \"cbrt (a * b * c) = 5\"\nand h2 : \"3 / (1/a + 1/b + 1/c) = 3\"\nshows  \"a powr 2 + b powr 2 + c powr 2 = 326\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
