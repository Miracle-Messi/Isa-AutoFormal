Since there are $10$ numbers in Row 5, and there are $12$ numbers in Row 6, the $20^{\\mathrm{th}}$ number if we start counting in Row 5 is located at the $10^{\\mathrm{th}}$ spot of Row 6, which is of course a $\\boxed{12}.$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes n :: nat and f :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> nat\"\nassumes h0 : \"f 1 = 2\"\nand h1 : \"f 2 = 4\"\nand h2 : \"f 3 = 6\"\nand h3 : \"f 4 = 8\"\nand h4 : \"\\<forall>n. n \\<ge> 5 \\<longrightarrow> f n = (2 * (n - 1))\"\nshows  \"f 40 = 12\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "A function $f(n)$ is defined as follows: $f(1)=2$, $f(2)=4$, $f(3)=6$, $f(4)=8$, and for all natural numbers $n \\geq 5$, $f(n) = 2(n-1)$. Find the value of $f(40)$. The final answer is 12."
