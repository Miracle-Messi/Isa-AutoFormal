        "informal problem": "In a shooting competition, each of the first 8 targets has the following scores: target 1 has 3 points, target 2 has 3 points, target 3 has 2 points, and targets 4 to 8 have 0 points. A shooter must hit a target with a non-zero score before hitting the next target with a non-zero score. \n\nHow many different sequences of 8 targets can the shooter hit such that for each target, the score is at most 3, no two consecutive targets have the same score, and the score of the hit target decreases by 1? The final answer is 560."
