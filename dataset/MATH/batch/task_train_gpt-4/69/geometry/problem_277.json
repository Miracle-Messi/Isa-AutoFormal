Then $[\\triangle ABC] = \\frac{1}{2}(h)(5)$, so the area is maximized when $A$ is most high above $\\overline {BC}$. Since $AP=2$, maximization occurs when $A$ is directly over $P$, leading to a height of $h=\\frac{12}{5}+2=\\frac{22}{5}$.\n In this case, \\[[\\triangle ABC] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{22}{5} \\right)(5)=\\boxed{11}.\\]\n *)\n\nUnfortunately, Isabelle is a proof assistant that deals primarily with logical and mathematical statements. It's not well-equipped to handle geometric problems that involve diagrams or visual representations. However, one can write a theorem that captures the essence of the problem in mathematical terms:\n\ntheorem\nfixes A B C P :: \"real*real\" and area :: \"(real*real) \\<Rightarrow> (real*real) \\<Rightarrow> (real*real) \\<Rightarrow> real\"\nassumes h0 : \"dist A P = 2\"\nand h1 : \"dist B P = 3\"\nand h2 : \"dist C P = 4\"\nand h3 : \"dist B C = 5\"\nshows  \"area A B C <= 11\"\n\nPlease note that this theorem is not fully accurate as Isabelle does not have built-in support for geometric functions like \"dist\" (distance) or \"area\", this is just a representation of how it might look like.\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
