The final Answer is \\approx 8.24 \\text{ mph}\n ### Proof\n Since Laura spends $5$ minutes in transition, a total of $110-5=105$ minutes are spent in motion. This is equivalent to $\\frac{105}{60}=1.75$ hours.\n We know that $\\text{distance}=\\text{rate}\\cdot\\text{time}$, so $\\text{time}=\\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{rate}}$.\n Thus the time Laura spends biking is $\\frac{20\\text{ miles}}{2x+1\\text{ mph}}=\\frac{20}{2x+1}\\text{ hours}$, and the time she spends running is $\\frac{5\\text{ miles}}{x\\text{ mph}}=\\frac{5}{x}\\text{ hours}$.\n Thus the total time Laura is in motion is $$\\frac{20}{2x+1}\\text{ hours}+\\frac{5}{x}\\text{ hours}=1.75\\text{ hours}.$$We can solve this equation by multiplying through by a common denominator: \\begin{align}\n (x)(2x+1)\\left(\\frac{20}{2x+1}+\\frac{5}{x}\\right)&=(1.75)(x)(2x+1)\\\\ 20(x)+5(2x+1)&=\\frac{7}{4}(2x^2+x)\\\\ 20x+10x+5&=\\frac{14x^2+7x}{4}\\\\ 4(30x+5)&=14x^2+7x\\\\ 120x+20&=14x^2+7x\\\\ 0&=14x^2-113x-20. \\end{align}We can solve this using the quadratic formula, by writing  \\begin{align}\n x&=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\\\\ &=\\frac{-(-113)\\pm\\sqrt{(-113)^2-4(14)(-20)}}{2(14)}\\\\ &=\\frac{113\\pm\\sqrt{13889}}{28}. \\end{align}The two solutions are approximately $-0.1733$ and $8.2447$.
