Recall that if any linear dimension (such as radius, side length, height, perimeter, etc.)\n of a two-dimensional figure is multiplied by $k$ while the shape of the figure remains the same, the area of the figure is multiplied by $k^2$. In this case, the perimeter of the small equilateral triangle is multiplied by 4 to obtain the large equilateral triangle, so the area of the larger triangle is $4^2=16$ times greater than that of the small triangle.\n Therefore, the ratio of the original area to the new area is four small triangles divided by 16 small triangles, which simplifies to $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes small_area large_area :: real\nassumes h0 : \"small_area > 0\"\nand h1 : \"large_area > 0\"\nand h2 : \"large_area = 4 * small_area\"\nshows  \"small_area / large_area = 1 / 4\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
