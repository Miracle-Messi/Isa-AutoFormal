        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n The decimal representation of $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers and $m < n,$ contains the digits $2, 5$, and $1$ consecutively, and in that order. Find the smallest value of $n$ for which this is possible.\n The final Answer is 127\n ### Proof\n To find the smallest value of $n$, we consider when the first three digits after the decimal point are $0.251\\ldots$. Otherwise, suppose the number is in the form of $\\frac{m}{n} = 0.X251 \\ldots$, where $X$ is a string of $k$ digits and $n$ is small as possible.\n Then $10^k \\cdot \\frac{m}{n} - X = \\frac{10^k m - nX}{n} = 0.251 \\ldots$. Since $10^k m - nX$ is an integer and $\\frac{10^k m - nX}{n}$ is a fraction between $0$ and $1$, we can rewrite this as $\\frac{10^k m - nX}{n} = \\frac{p}{q}$, where $q \\le n$.\n Then the fraction $\\frac pq = 0.251 \\ldots$ suffices.\n Thus we have $\\frac{m}{n} = 0.251\\ldots$, or $\\frac{251}{1000} \\le \\frac{m}{n} < \\frac{252}{1000} \\Longleftrightarrow 251n \\le 1000m < 252n \\Longleftrightarrow n \\le 250(4m-n) < 2n.$ As $4m > n$, we know that the minimum value of $4m - n$ is $1$; hence we need $250 < 2n \\Longrightarrow 125 < n$.\n Since $4m - n = 1$, we need $n + 1$ to be divisible by $4$, and this first occurs when $n = \\boxed{127}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes m n :: nat\nassumes h0 : \"coprime m n\"\nand h1 : \"m < n\"\nand h2 : \"contains_digit_251 (m / n)\"\nshows  \"n = 127\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
