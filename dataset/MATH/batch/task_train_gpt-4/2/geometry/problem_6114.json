Find $a + b + c$.\n The final Answer is 150\n ### Proof\n First, by the Law of Cosines, we have\\[\\cos BAC = \\frac {16^2 + 10^2 - 14^2}{2\\cdot 10 \\cdot 16} = \\frac {256+100-196}{320} = \\frac {1}{2},\\]so $\\angle BAC = 60^\\circ$.\n Let $O_1$ and $O_2$ be the circumcenters of triangles $BI_BD$ and $CI_CD$, respectively.\n We first compute\\[\\angle BO_1D = \\angle BO_1I_B + \\angle I_BO_1D = 2\\angle BDI_B + 2\\angle I_BBD.\\]Because $\\angle BDI_B$ and $\\angle I_BBD$ are half of $\\angle BDA$ and $\\angle ABD$, respectively, the above expression can be simplified to\\[\\angle BO_1D = \\angle BO_1I_B + \\angle I_BO_1D = 2\\angle BDI_B + 2\\angle I_BBD = \\angle ABD + \\angle BDA.\\]Similarly, $\\angle CO_2D = \\angle ACD + \\angle CDA$.\n As a result\\begin{align}\\angle CPB &= \\angle CPD + \\angle BPD \\\\&= \\frac {1}{2} \\cdot \\angle CO_2D + \\frac {1}{2} \\cdot \\angle BO_1D \\\\&= \\frac {1}{2}(\\angle ABD + \\angle BDA + \\angle ACD + \\angle CDA) \\\\&= \\frac {1}{2} (2 \\cdot 180^\\circ - \\angle BAC) \\\\&= \\frac {1}{2} \\cdot 300^\\circ = 150^\\circ.\\end{align}\n Therefore $\\angle CPB$ is constant ($150^\\circ$). Also, $P$ is $B$ or $C$ when $D$ is $B$ or $C$.\n Let point $L$ be on the same side of $\\overline{BC}$ as $A$ with $LC = LB = BC = 14$; $P$ is on the circle with $L$ as the center and $\\overline{LC}$ as the radius, which is $14$. The shortest distance from $L$ to $\\overline{BC}$ is $7\\sqrt {3}$.\n When the area of $\\triangle BPC$ is the maximum, the distance from $P$ to $\\overline{BC}$ has to be the greatest. In this case, it's $14 - 7\\sqrt {3}$. The maximum area of $\\triangle BPC$ is\\[\\frac {1}{2} \\cdot 14 \\cdot (14 - 7\\sqrt {3}) = 98 - 49 \\sqrt {3}\\]and the requested answer is $98 + 49 + 3 = \\boxed{150}$.\n *)\n\nDue to the complexity and nature of the problem, it's not possible to directly translate this into a theorem in Isabelle. Isabelle is a theorem prover and not well-suited to handle geometric constructions or optimizations. However, you could represent certain parts of the problem in Isabelle.\n\nFor instance, you can represent the triangle as below:\n\ndatatype Point = Point real real\n\ndatatype Triangle = Triangle Point Point Point\n\ndefinition ABC :: Triangle where\n\"ABC = Triangle (Point 0 0) (Point 10 0) (Point 7 (sqrt (16^2 - 7^2)))\"\n\nThe representation above defines a Triangle datatype which consists of three Points, each with two real numbers representing x and y coordinates. The triangle ABC is defined with points A, B, and C at specified coordinates. \n\nHowever, the full problem involving geometric operations and optimizations would need to be handled by a more specialized tool, such as a geometry software or a symbolic computation system like Mathematica.\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
