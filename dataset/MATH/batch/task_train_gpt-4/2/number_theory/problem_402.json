Six of them are odd and five are even. There are $3$ multiples of $25$ that are less than $100$. Two of them are odd and one is even. There are $2$ multiples of $49$ that are less than $100$.\n One of them is odd and one is even.\n Therefore, there are $9$ odd integers that are not square-free. The least integer which is divisible by at least two of the integers 9, 25, and 49 is $9\\cdot 25 = 225$, which is greater than 100.\n Therefore, there are 9 odd integers less than 100 which are divisible by a perfect square greater than 1. There are $49$ odd integers less than $100$ and greater than 1, so there are $49-9=\\boxed{40}$ odd square-free integers less than $100$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes n :: int\nassumes h0 : \"n > 1\"\nand h1 : \"n < 100\"\nand h2 : \"\\<forall> k. k * k \\<noteq> 1 \\<longrightarrow> \\<not> k * k dvd n\"\nand h3 : \"odd n\"\nshows  \"card {n. n > 1 \\<and> n < 100 \\<and> (\\<forall> k. k * k \\<noteq> 1 \\<longrightarrow> \\<not> k * k dvd n) \\<and> odd n} = 40\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
