        "informal problem": "Jackie and Phil are playing a game where they each flip a coin three times. Jackie wins if the number of heads in her flips is equal to the number of heads in Phil's flips. The probability of a coin landing heads for Jackie is $\\frac{4}{7}$, while the probability for Phil is $\\frac{1}{2}$. What is the sum of the numerator and the denominator of the probability that Jackie and Phil have the same number of heads, given that the fraction is in its lowest terms? The final answer is 515."
