        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n An ellipse has its foci at $(-1, -1)$ and $(-1, -3).$ Given that it passes through the point $(4, -2),$ its equation can be written in the form \\[\\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} + \\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1\\]where $a, b, h, k$ are constants, and $a$ and $b$ are positive. Find $a+k.$ The final Answer is 3\n ### Proof\n The sum of the distances from $(4, -2)$ to the foci of the ellipse is \\[\\sqrt{(4+1)^2 + (-1+2)^2} + \\sqrt{(4+1)^2 + (-3+2)^2} = 2\\sqrt{26}.\\]This is also equal to the length of the major axis of the ellipse.\n Since the distance between the foci is $2,$ it follows that the length of the minor axis of the ellipse is $\\sqrt{(2\\sqrt{26})^2 - 2^2} = 10.$ The center of the ellipse is the midpoint of the segment containing points $(-1, -1)$ and $(-1, -3),$ which is $(-1, -2).$ Since the two foci have the same $x$-coordinate, the vertical axis is the major axis.\n Putting all this together, we get that the equation of the ellipse is \\[\\frac{(x+1)^2}{5^2} + \\frac{(y+2)^2}{(\\sqrt{26})^2} = 1.\\]Thus, $a+k = 5 + (-2) = \\boxed{3}.$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes a b h k x y :: real\nassumes h0 : \"h = -1\"\nand h1 : \"k = -2\"\nand h2 : \"a > 0\"\nand h3 : \"b > 0\"\nand h4 : \"(x - h) powr 2 / a powr 2 + (y - k) powr 2 / b powr 2 = 1\"\nand h5 : \"x = 4\"\nand h6 : \"y = -2\"\nshows  \"a + k = 3\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
