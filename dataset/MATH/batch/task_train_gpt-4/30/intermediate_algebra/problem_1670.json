        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n Let $f(n)$ be the base-10 logarithm of the sum of the elements of the $n$th row in Pascal's triangle. Express $\\frac{f(n)}{\\log_{10} 2}$ in terms of $n$. Recall that Pascal's triangle begins\n\n\\begin{tabular}{rccccccccc}\n$n=0$:& & & & & 1\\\\\\noalign{\\smallskip\\smallskip}\n$n=1$:& & & & 1 & & 1\\\\\\noalign{\\smallskip\\smallskip}\n$n=2$:& & & 1 & & 2 & & 1\\\\\\noalign{\\smallskip\\smallskip}\n$n=3$:& & 1 & & 3 & & 3 & & 1\\\\\\noalign{\\smallskip\\smallskip}\n$n=4$:& 1 & & 4 & & 6 & & 4 & & 1\\\\\\noalign{\\smallskip\\smallskip}\n& & & & & $\\vdots$ & & & &\n\n\\end{tabular} The final Answer is n\n ### Proof\n Computing the sums of the entries in the first few rows suggestions that the sum of the entries in row $n$ is $2^n$. Indeed, one way to prove this formula is to note that the $k$th entry of the $n$th row is $\\binom{n}{k}$ (if we say that the entries in the $n$th row are numbered $k=0,1,\\dots,n$).\n We have  \\[ \\binom{n}{0}+\\binom{n}{1}+\\binom{n}{2}+\\dots +\\binom{n}{n} = 2^n, \\]since both sides calculate the number of ways to choose some subset of $n$ objects. It follows that $f(n)=\\log_{10} (2^n)$, which means that $\\frac{f(n)}{\\log_{10} 2}=\\frac{\\log_{10} (2^n)}{\\log_{10} 2}$.\n Applying the change of base formula gives us $\\log_2 (2^n)=\\boxed{n}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes f :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> real\"\nassumes h0 : \"f 0 = 0\"\nand h1 : \"\\<forall> n. n > 0 \\<Longrightarrow> f n = log 10 (sum (\\<lambda> k. binomial n k) {0..n})\"\nshows  \"f n / log 10 2 = n\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "A real-valued function $f$ is defined on the natural numbers as follows: $f(0) = 0$ and $f(n) = \\log_{10}\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{n} {n \\choose k}\\right)$ for all $n > 0$. Find $f(n)$ divided by $\\log_{10}(2)$ for a given $n$. The final answer is $n$."
