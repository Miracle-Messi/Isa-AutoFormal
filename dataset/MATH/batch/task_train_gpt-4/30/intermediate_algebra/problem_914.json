The roots of $g$ are: \\begin{align} x_{1,2} = \\frac{ 360 \\pm \\sqrt{ 360^2 - 4\\cdot 400 } }2 = 180 \\pm 80 \\sqrt 5 \\end{align}We can then write $g(x) = (x - 180 - 80\\sqrt 5)(x - 180 + 80\\sqrt 5)$, and thus $f(x) = (x^2 - 180 - 80\\sqrt 5)(x^2 - 180 + 80\\sqrt 5)$.\n We would now like to factor the right hand side further, using the formula $(x^2 - y^2) = (x-y)(x+y)$.\n To do this, we need to express both constants as squares of some other constants.
