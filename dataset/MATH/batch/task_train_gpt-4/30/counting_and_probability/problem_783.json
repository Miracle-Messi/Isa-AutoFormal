These can only occur in the sets $\\{1, 4\\}$, $\\{1, 5 \\}$ or $\\{ 2, 5 \\}$.\n Each of these unordered pairs can occur in 2 orderings (depending on whether Jane or her brother spins each number).\n So, there are $2 \\cdot 3 = 6$ losing combinations out of $5 \\cdot 5 = 25$ for Jane.\n So, her winning probability is $1 - \\frac{6}{25} = \\boxed{\\frac{19}{25}}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes probability :: real\nassumes h0 : \"probability = (\\<Sum> (i, j) | i \\<in> {1..5} \\<and> j \\<in> {1..5} \\<and> abs (i - j) < 3. 1) / 25\"\nshows  \"probability = 19 / 25\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
