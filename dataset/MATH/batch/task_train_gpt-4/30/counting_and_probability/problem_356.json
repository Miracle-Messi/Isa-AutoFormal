This will happen if at least one of the factors is a multiple of 5, which will mean $a$ or $b$ is one less than a multiple of 5.\n There are 10 integers from 1 to 50 inclusive that are 1 less than a multiple of 5: $4,9,14, \\dots, 49$.\n So, the number of ways to choose $a$ and $b$ so the product is $\\textit{not}$ a multiple of 5 is $\\binom{40}{2}=780$.\n Therefore, there are $1225-780=445$ ways to choose $a$ and $b$ that do satisfy the requirement, which gives a probability of: $$\\frac{445}{1225}=\\boxed{\\frac{89}{245}}$$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes S P :: nat\nassumes h0 : \"1 \\<le> S \\<and> S \\<le> 50\"\nand h1 : \"P = (\\<Sum>x | 1 \\<le> x \\<and> x \\<le> 50 \\<and> x \\<noteq> S. x * (S - x))\"\nand h2 : \"(P + S) mod 5 = 4\"\nshows  \"probability = 89 / 245\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "There are 50 students in a class, each labeled with a unique number between 1 and 50. For each student, except student S, we calculate the product of their number and the difference between their number and S's number. We then sum up all these products and call this sum P. If P plus the student S's number gives a remainder of 4 when divided by 5, find the probability that S is the desired student. The final answer is $\\frac{89}{245}$."
