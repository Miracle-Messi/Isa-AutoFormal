By how many square inches is the area of the circle greater than the area of square?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.

[asy] size(85); draw(circle((1,1),1.414)); draw((2,0)--(0,2));\n label(\"$5$\",(1,1),NE); [/asy] Since the diameter of the circle is $5$, its radius is $\\frac{5}{2}$, and its area is $\\pi \\displaystyle\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\displaystyle\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{4}\\pi$, which is approximately $19.63$.\n The difference between the two areas is approximately $19.63 - 12.5 = 7.13$, which, to the nearest tenth, is $7.1$.\n Thus the area of the circle is greater than the area of the square by $\\boxed{7.1}$ square inches.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes d :: real and area_square area_circle :: real\nassumes h0 : \"d = 5\"\nand h1 : \"area_square = (d / sqrt 2) ^ 2\"\nand h2 : \"area_circle = pi * (d / 2) ^ 2\"\nshows  \"area_circle - area_square = 7.1\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
