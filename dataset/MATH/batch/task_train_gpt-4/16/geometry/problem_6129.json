Since $E$ and $F$ are midpoints, $BE = 15$ and $CF = 7$. $B$ and $C$ are located on the circumference of the circle, so $OB = OC = 25$.\n The line through the midpoint of a chord of a circle and the center of that circle is perpendicular to that chord, so $\\triangle OEB$ and $\\triangle OFC$ are right triangles (with $\\angle OEB$ and $\\angle OFC$ being the right angles).\n By the Pythagorean Theorem, $OE = \\sqrt{25^2 - 15^2} = 20$, and $OF = \\sqrt{25^2 - 7^2} = 24$.\n Let $x$, $a$, and $b$ be lengths $OP$, $EP$, and $FP$, respectively. OEP and OFP are also right triangles, so $x^2 = a^2 + 20^2 \\to a^2 = x^2 - 400$, and $x^2 = b^2 + 24^2 \\to b^2 = x^2 - 576$\n We are given that $EF$ has length 12, so, using the Law of Cosines with $\\triangle EPF$: $12^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cos (\\angle EPF) = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cos (\\angle EPO + \\angle FPO)$\n Substituting for $a$ and $b$, and applying the Cosine of Sum formula: $144 = (x^2 - 400) + (x^2 - 576) - 2 \\sqrt{x^2 - 400} \\sqrt{x^2 - 576} \\left( \\cos \\angle EPO \\cos \\angle FPO - \\sin \\angle EPO \\sin \\angle FPO \\right)$\n $\\angle EPO$ and $\\angle FPO$ are acute angles in right triangles, so substitute opposite/hypotenuse for sines and adjacent/hypotenuse for cosines: $144 = 2x^2 - 976 - 2 \\sqrt{(x^2 - 400)(x^2 - 576)} \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{x^2 - 400}}{x} \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2 - 576}}{x} - \\frac{20}{x} \\frac{24}{x} \\right)$\n Combine terms and multiply both sides by $x^2$: $144 x^2 = 2 x^4 - 976 x^2 - 2 (x^2 - 400) (x^2 - 576) + 960  \\sqrt{(x^2 - 400)(x^2 - 576)}$\n Combine terms again, and divide both sides by 64: $13 x^2 = 7200 - 15 \\sqrt{x^4 - 976 x^2 + 230400}$ Square both sides: $169 x^4 - 187000 x^2 + 51,840,000 = 225 x^4 - 219600 x^2 + 51,840,000$ This reduces to $x^2 = \\frac{4050}{7} = (OP)^2$; $4050 + 7 \\equiv \\boxed{57} \\pmod{1000}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes O A B C D P :: \"real * real\"\nand r :: real\nand AB CD OP :: real\nassumes h0 : \"r = 25\"\nand h1 : \"dist A B = 30\"\nand h2 : \"dist C D = 14\"\nand h3 : \"dist (midpoint A B) (midpoint C D) = 12\"\nand h4 : \"OP = sqrt (fst P * fst P + snd P * snd P)\"\nand h5 : \"OP^2 = real_of_rat (Fract m n) \\<and> coprime m n\"\nand h6 : \"(m + n) mod 1000 = 57\"\nshows  \"57 = (m + n) mod 1000\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",

        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n A circle with center $O$ has radius 25. Chord $\\overline{AB}$ of length 30 and chord $\\overline{CD}$ of length 14 intersect at point $P$. The distance between the midpoints of the two chords is 12. The quantity $OP^2$ can be represented as $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find the remainder when $m + n$ is divided by 1000.\n The final Answer is 57\n ### Proof\n Let $E$ and $F$ be the midpoints of $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{CD}$, respectively, such that $\\overline{BE}$ intersects $\\overline{CF}$. Since $E$ and $F$ are midpoints, $BE = 15$ and $CF = 7$. $B$ and $C$ are located on the circumference of the circle, so $OB = OC = 25$.\n The line through the midpoint of a chord of a circle and the center of that circle is perpendicular to that chord, so $\\triangle OEB$ and $\\triangle OFC$ are right triangles (with $\\angle OEB$ and $\\angle OFC$ being the right angles).\n By the Pythagorean Theorem, $OE = \\sqrt{25^2 - 15^2} = 20$, and $OF = \\sqrt{25^2 - 7^2} = 24$.\n Let $x$, $a$, and $b$ be lengths $OP$, $EP$, and $FP$, respectively. OEP and OFP are also right triangles, so $x^2 = a^2 + 20^2 \\to a^2 = x^2 - 400$, and $x^2 = b^2 + 24^2 \\to b^2 = x^2 - 576$\n We are given that $EF$ has length 12, so, using the Law of Cosines with $\\triangle EPF$: $12^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cos (\\angle EPF) = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cos (\\angle EPO + \\angle FPO)$\n Substituting for $a$ and $b$, and applying the Cosine of Sum formula: $144 = (x^2 - 400) + (x^2 - 576) - 2 \\sqrt{x^2 - 400} \\sqrt{x^2 - 576} \\left( \\cos \\angle EPO \\cos \\angle FPO - \\sin \\angle EPO \\sin \\angle FPO \\right)$\n $\\angle EPO$ and $\\angle FPO$ are acute angles in right triangles, so substitute opposite/hypotenuse for sines and adjacent/hypotenuse for cosines: $144 = 2x^2 - 976 - 2 \\sqrt{(x^2 - 400)(x^2 - 576)} \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{x^2 - 400}}{x} \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2 - 576}}{x} - \\frac{20}{x} \\frac{24}{x} \\right)$\n Combine terms and multiply both sides by $x^2$: $144 x^2 = 2 x^4 - 976 x^2 - 2 (x^2 - 400) (x^2 - 576) + 960  \\sqrt{(x^2 - 400)(x^2 - 576)}$\n Combine terms again, and divide both sides by 64: $13 x^2 = 7200 - 15 \\sqrt{x^4 - 976 x^2 + 230400}$ Square both sides: $169 x^4 - 187000 x^2 + 51,840,000 = 225 x^4 - 219600 x^2 + 51,840,000$ This reduces to $x^2 = \\frac{4050}{7} = (OP)^2$; $4050 + 7 \\equiv \\boxed{57} \\pmod{1000}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes O P :: \"real^2\"\nand A B C D :: \"real^2\"\nand r m n :: real\nassumes h0 : \"norm(O - A) = r\"\nand h1 : \"norm(O - B) = r\"\nand h2 : \"norm(O - C) = r\"\nand h3 : \"norm(O - D) = r\"\nand h4 : \"r = 25\"\nand h5 : \"norm(A - B) = 30\"\nand h6 : \"norm(C - D) = 14\"\nand h7 : \"norm((A + B)/2 - (C + D)/2) = 12\"\nand h8 : \"m / n = ((norm(O - P))^2) mod 1000\"\nand h9 : \"gcd m n = 1\"\nshows  \"m + n mod 1000 = 57\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "Given four points A, B, C, and D in a 2D plane with the same distance r from a center point O, where r equals 25 units. The distance between A and B is 30 units, and the distance between C and D is 14 units. The distance between the midpoint of the line segment AB and the midpoint of the line segment CD is 12 units. Now, consider another point P in the plane such that the ratio of the square of the distance from O to P over a number n is congruent to a number m modulo 1000. Given that m and n are coprime, what is the sum of m and n modulo 1000? The final answer is 57."
