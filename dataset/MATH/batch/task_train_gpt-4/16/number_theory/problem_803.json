        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n Nine stones are arranged in a straight line. They are counted from  left to right as $1,2,3, \\ldots, 9$, and then from right to left, so that the stone previously counted as 8 is counted as 10. The pattern is continued to the left until the stone previously counted as 1 is counted as 17. The pattern then reverses so that the stone originally counted as 2 is counted as 18, 3 as 19, and so on. The counting continues in this manner. Which of the original stones is counted as 99? Express your answer as a single digit which corresponds to the first digit assigned to that stone. The final Answer is 3\n ### Proof\n First we note that 16 stones are enumerated before the pattern repeats.\n Therefore, if the count enumerates a stone as $n$, then that stone is enumerated $k$ for every  \\[k\\equiv n\\pmod{16}\\] (though all but the end stones are represented by two residue classes in this way).\n Since $99\\equiv3\\pmod{16}$, stone number $\\boxed{3}$ is counted as 99.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes f :: \"int \\<Rightarrow> int\"\nassumes h0 : \"\\<forall> n. 1 \\<le> n \\<and> n \\<le> 9 \\<longrightarrow> f n = n\"\nand h1 : \"\\<forall> n. 10 \\<le> n \\<and> n \\<le> 17 \\<longrightarrow> f n = 18 - n\"\nand h2 : \"\\<forall> n. 18 \\<le> n \\<and> n \\<le> 25 \\<longrightarrow> f n = n - 8\"\nand h3 : \"\\<forall> n. 26 \\<le> n \\<and> n \\<le> 33 \\<longrightarrow> f n = 34 - n\"\nand h4 : \"\\<forall> n. 34 \\<le> n \\<and> n \\<le> 41 \\<longrightarrow> f n = n - 16\"\nand h5 : \"\\<forall> n. 42 \\<le> n \\<and> n \\<le> 49 \\<longrightarrow> f n = 50 - n\"\nand h6 : \"\\<forall> n. 50 \\<le> n \\<and> n \\<le> 57 \\<longrightarrow> f n = n - 24\"\nand h7 : \"\\<forall> n. 58 \\<le> n \\<and> n \\<le> 65 \\<longrightarrow> f n = 66 - n\"\nand h8 : \"\\<forall> n. 66 \\<le> n \\<and> n \\<le> 73 \\<longrightarrow> f n = n - 32\"\nand h9 : \"\\<forall> n. 74 \\<le> n \\<and> n \\<le> 81 \\<longrightarrow> f n = 82 - n\"\nand h10 : \"\\<forall> n. 82 \\<le> n \\<and> n \\<le> 89 \\<longrightarrow> f n = n - 40\"\nand h11 : \"\\<forall> n. 90 \\<le> n \\<and> n \\<le> 97 \\<longrightarrow> f n = 98 - n\"\nand h12 : \"\\<forall> n. 98 \\<le> n \\<and> n \\<le> 105 \\<longrightarrow> f n = n - 48\"\nshows  \"f 99 = 3\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
