        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n The Lucas sequence is the sequence 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, $\\ldots$ where the first term is 1, the second term is 3 and each term after that is the sum of the previous two terms. What is the remainder when the $100^{\\mathrm{th}}$ term of the sequence is divided by 8? The final Answer is 7\n ### Proof\n We can look at the terms of the Lucas sequence modulo 8. \\begin{align} L_1 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}, \\\\ L_2 &\\equiv 3\\pmod{8}, \\\\ L_3 &\\equiv 4\\pmod{8}, \\\\ L_4 &\\equiv 7\\pmod{8}, \\\\ L_5 &\\equiv 3\\pmod{8}, \\\\ L_6 &\\equiv 2\\pmod{8}, \\\\\n L_7 &\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}, \\\\ L_8 &\\equiv 7\\pmod{8}, \\\\ L_9 &\\equiv 4\\pmod{8}, \\\\ L_{10} &\\equiv 3\\pmod{8}, \\\\ L_{11} &\\equiv 7\\pmod{8}, \\\\ L_{12} &\\equiv 2\\pmod{8}, \\\\ L_{13} &\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}, \\\\ L_{14} &\\equiv 3\\pmod{8}, \\\\\n L_{15} &\\equiv 4\\pmod{8}, \\\\ L_{16} &\\equiv 7\\pmod{8}. \\end{align}Since $L_{13}=1$ and $L_{14}=3$, the sequence begins repeating at the 13th term, so it repeats every 12 terms. Since the remainder is 4 when we divide 100 by 12, we know $L_{100}\\equiv L_4\\pmod 8$.\n Therefore the remainder when $L_{100}$ is divided by 8 is $\\boxed{7}$.\n *)\n\nprimrec Lucas :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> nat\"\nwhere\n\"Lucas 0 = 1\" |\n\"Lucas 1 = 3\" |\n\"Lucas (Suc (Suc n)) = Lucas (Suc n) + Lucas n\"\n\ntheorem \nshows  \"Lucas 100 mod 8 = 7\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
