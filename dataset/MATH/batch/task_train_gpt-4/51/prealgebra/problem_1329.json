        "informal problem": "Given a right triangle with sides of lengths a, b, and c, where c is the hypotenuse and all sides are positive real numbers. If the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (i.e., c\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2), then the length of side a is the square root of the difference between the square of the length of the hypotenuse and the square of the length of side b (i.e., a = \u221a(c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)). Similarly, the length of side b is the square root of the difference between the square of the length of the hypotenuse and the square of the length of side a (i.e., b = \u221a(c\u00b2 - a\u00b2)). Finally, the length of the hypotenuse c is the square root of the sum of the squares of the lengths of sides a and b (i.e., c = \u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)). This is a formal expression of the Pythagorean theorem."
