Four cards are drawn from the box at random and without replacement. Let $p$ be the probability that all four cards bear the same number. Let $q$ be the probability that three of the cards bear a number $a$ and the other bears a number $b$ that is not equal to $a$. What is the value of $q/p$? The final Answer is 144\n ### Proof\n The total number of ways that the numbers can be chosen is $\\binom{40}{4}.$ Exactly 10 of these possibilities result in the four cards having the same number.\n Now we need to determine the number of ways that three cards can have a number $a$ and the other card have a number $b$, with $b\\ne a$. There are $10\\cdot 9 = 90$  ways to choose the distinct numbers $a$ and $b$.\n (Notice that the order in which we choose these two number matters, since we get 3 of $a$ and 1 of $b$.) For each value of $a$ there are $\\binom{4}{3}$ ways to choose the three cards with $a$ and for each value of $b$ there are $\\binom{4}{1}$ ways to choose the card with $b$.\n Hence the number of ways that three cards have some  number $a$ and the other card has some distinct number $b$ is $$90\\cdot\\binom{4}{3}\\cdot\\binom{4}{1}=90\\cdot 4 \\cdot 4 = 1440.$$ So the probabilities $p$ and $q$ are $\\displaystyle \\frac{10}{\\binom{40}{4}}$ and $\\displaystyle \\frac{1440}{\\binom{40}{4}}$, respectively, which implies that $$\\frac{q}{p} = \\frac{1440}{10} = \\boxed{144}.$$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes p q :: real\nassumes h0 : \"p = (1 / 10) * (3 / 39) * (2 / 38) * (1 / 37)\"\nand h1 : \"q = (10 * 9 / 2) * (4 / 40) * (3 / 39) * (3 / 38) * (1 / 37)\"\nshows  \"q / p = 144\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
