        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n The Fibonacci sequence is the sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, $\\ldots$ where the first and second terms are 1 and each term after that is the sum of the previous two terms. What is the remainder when the $100^{\\mathrm{th}}$ term of the sequence is divided by 8? The final Answer is 3\n ### Proof\n We can look at the terms of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 8. \\begin{align} F_1 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}, \\\\ F_2 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}, \\\\ F_3 &\\equiv 2\\pmod{8}, \\\\ F_4 &\\equiv 3\\pmod{8}, \\\\ F_5 &\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}, \\\\\n F_6 &\\equiv 0\\pmod{8}, \\\\ F_7 &\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}, \\\\ F_8 &\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}, \\\\ F_9 &\\equiv 2\\pmod{8}, \\\\ F_{10} &\\equiv 7\\pmod{8}, \\\\ F_{11} &\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}, \\\\ F_{12} &\\equiv 0\\pmod{8}, \\\\ F_{13} &\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}, \\\\\n F_{14} &\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}, \\\\ F_{15} &\\equiv 2\\pmod{8}, \\\\ F_{16} &\\equiv 3\\pmod{8}. \\end{align}Since $F_{13}$ and $F_{14}$ are both 1, the sequence begins repeating at the 13th term, so it repeats every 12 terms.\n Since the remainder is 4 when we divide 100 by 12, we know $F_{100}\\equiv F_4\\pmod 8$.\n Therefore the remainder when $F_{100}$ is divided by 8 is $\\boxed{3}$.\n *)\n\nfun fib :: \"nat \u21d2 nat\"\nwhere\n\"fib 0 = 0\" |\n\"fib (Suc 0) = 1\" |\n\"fib (Suc (Suc n)) = fib n + fib (Suc n)\"\n\ntheorem\nshows  \"fib 100 mod 8 = 3\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
