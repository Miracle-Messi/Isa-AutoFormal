Next, we consider triangles that have $P$ or $Q$ as the vertices.\n We can set $PQ$ as a leg of the right triangles and get $4$ right triangles with the third vertex $A,B,C$, and $D$. Lastly, we can draw the diagonals $DP, CP, AQ$, and $BQ$. Since $ADQP$ and $BCQP$ are squares, each diagonal creates a $45$ degree angle with the line segment $PQ$.\n Therefore, we have two right triangles: $DPC$ and $AQB$.\n Adding them together, we have a total of $$8+4+2=\\boxed{14 \\text{ right triangles}}.$$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes A B C D P Q :: point\nassumes h0 : \"is_rectangle A B C D\"\nand h1 : \"is_segment PQ\"\nand h2 : \"PQ \\<subseteq> rectangle ABCD\"\nand h3 : \"is_square A P Q D\"\nand h4 : \"is_square B P Q C\"\nshows  \"count_right_triangles_using_vertices {A, B, C, D, P, Q} = 14\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "Given a rectangle ABCD and a line segment PQ such that PQ is contained within the rectangle. If APQD and BPQC are squares, how many right triangles can be formed using the points A, B, C, D, P, Q as vertices? The final answer is 14."
