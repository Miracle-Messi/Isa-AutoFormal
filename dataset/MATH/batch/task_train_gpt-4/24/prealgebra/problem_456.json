The final Answer is 38\n ### Proof\n Since the given segments are perpendicular, we have two consecutive right angles. Since $AB\\ne DC$, we know the quadrilateral is not a rectangle.

The bottom leg of the triangle is the same length as $\\overline{BC}$ since they are opposite sides of a rectangle.\n So we have a right triangle with legs of length 5 and 12.\n We could use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve for the length of the hypotenuse, or we recognize that 5 and 12 are part of the Pythagorean triple $(5,12,13)$.\n So the length of the hypotenuse $\\overline{AD}$ is 13 units.
