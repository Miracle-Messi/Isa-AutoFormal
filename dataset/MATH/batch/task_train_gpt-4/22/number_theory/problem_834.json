        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n For a nonnegative integer $n$, let $r_9(n)$ stand for the remainder left when $n$ is divided by $9.$ For example, $r_9(25)=7.$\n\nWhat is the $22^{\\text{nd}}$ entry in an ordered list of all nonnegative integers $n$ that satisfy $$r_9(5n)\\le 4~?$$(Note that the first entry in this list is $0$.) The final Answer is 38\n ### Proof\n The condition $r_9(5n)\\le 4$ can also be stated as $``5n\\equiv 0,1,2,3,\\text{ or }4\\pmod 9. \"$'\n We can then restate that condition again by multiplying both sides by $2:$ $$10n \\equiv 0,2,4,6,\\text{ or }8\\pmod 9.$$This step is reversible (since $2$ has an inverse modulo $9$).\n Thus, it neither creates nor removes solutions. Moreover, the left side reduces to $n$ modulo $9,$ giving us the precise solution set $$n \\equiv 0,2,4,6,\\text{ or }8\\pmod 9.$$We wish to determine the $22^{\\text{nd}}$ nonnegative integer in this solution set.\n The first few solutions follow this pattern: $$\\begin{array}{c c c c c} 0 & 2 & 4 & 6 & 8 \\\\ 9 & 11 & 13 & 15 & 17 \\\\ 18 & 20 & 22 & 24 & 26 \\\\ 27 & 29 & 31 & 33 & 35 \\\\ 36 & 38 & \\cdots \\end{array}$$The $22^{\\text{nd}}$ solution is $\\boxed{38}.$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes n :: nat and r_9 :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> nat\"\nassumes h0 : \"\\<forall> n. r_9 n = n mod 9\"\nand h1 : \"r_9 (5 * n) \\<le> 4\"\nshows  \"(let list = sorted_list_of_set {n. r_9 (5 * n) \\<le> 4} in list ! 21) = 38\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
