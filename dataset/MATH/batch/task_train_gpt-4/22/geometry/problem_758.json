If the new pyramid is added to a triangular face, it will cover one of these faces while adding 1 new vertex, 3 new edges, and 3 new faces. If instead the new pyramid is added to a quadrilateral face, it will cover one of these faces while adding 1 new vertex, 4 new edges, and 4 new faces.\n So, we maximize the sum by adding a pyramid to a quadrilateral face. This gives us a solid with $5-1+4 = 8$ faces, $9+4=13$ edges, and $6 + 1 = 7$ vertices. The sum of these is $\\boxed{28}$.\n *)\n\nThe Isabelle language is not well-suited for handling geometric problems involving visual elements such as diagrams.
