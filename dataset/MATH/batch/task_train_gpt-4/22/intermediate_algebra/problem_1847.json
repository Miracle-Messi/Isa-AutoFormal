For all $n = 1, 2, \\ldots, 1000,$ the number $n + \\sqrt{n+1}$ is a root of the given polynomial, so we think that each root must have its corresponding conjugate root, which gives $2 \\cdot 1000 = 2000$ roots in total.\n However, not all of the numbers $n + \\sqrt{n+1}$ are irrational: when $n+1$ is a perfect square, the number is rational (in fact, an integer), so it has no associated radical conjugate. There are $30$ values of $n$ for which $n+1$ is a perfect square, since $n+1$ can be any of the perfect squares $2^2, 3^2, \\ldots, 31^2.$ Therefore, we adjust our initial count by $30,$ so that the polynomial must have at least $2000 - 30 = 1970$ roots.\n Since the number of roots of a polynomial is equal to its degree, the smallest possible degree of the given polynomial is $\\boxed{1970}.$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes P :: \"real \\<Rightarrow> real\"\nassumes h0 : \"\\<forall>n \\<in> {1..1000}.

        "informal problem": "Consider a polynomial P such that for all n in the set {1,2,...,1000}, P(n + sqrt(n + 1)) = 0. Moreover, assume that P is nonzero for all x and that for all x there exists a rational number q such that P(x) equals the real number equivalent of q. What is the degree of polynomial P? The answer is 1970."
