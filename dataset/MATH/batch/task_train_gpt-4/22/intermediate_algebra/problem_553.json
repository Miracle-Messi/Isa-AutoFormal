The final Answer is 490\n ### Proof\n To say that $k = (a_3a_2a_1a_0)_{-3+i}$ is to say that \\[k = a_3(-3+i)^3 + a_2(-3+i)^2 + a_1(-3+i) + a_0.\\]Expanding the right-hand side, we have  \\[k = (-18a_3+8a_2-3a_1+a_0) + (26a_3-6a_2+a_1)i.\\]Since $k$ is a real number, the imaginary part of the right-hand side must be zero; that is, \\[26a_3 - 6a_2 + a_1 = 0\\]or \\[26a_3 = 6a_2 - a_1.\\]Remember that $0 \\le a_1, a_2, a_3\\le 9$, so $6a_2 - a_1 \\le 6 \\cdot 9 - 0 = 54$.\n Thus, $26a_3 \\le 54$, so $a_3 \\le 2$.\n We take cases, remembering that $a_3 \\neq 0$: If $a_3 = 1$, then we have $6a_2 - a_1 = 26$. The only solution to this equation is $(a_1, a_2) = (4, 5)$, so we have \\[k = -18a_3 + 8a_2 - 3a_1 + a_0 = -18 \\cdot 1 + 8 \\cdot 5 -3 \\cdot 4 + a_0 = 10 + a_0.\\]Since $a_0 \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 9\\}$, the possible values of $k$ are $10, 11, 12, \\ldots, 19$, and these have a sum \\[10 + 11 + 12 + \\dots + 19 = \\frac{29 \\cdot 10}{2} = 145.\\]\n If $a_3 = 2$, then we have $6a_2 - a_1 = 52$. The only solution to this equation is $(a_1, a_2) = (2, 9)$, so we have \\[k = -18a_3 + 8a_2 - 3a_1 + a_0 = -18 \\cdot 2 + 8 \\cdot 9 -3 \\cdot 2 + a_0 = 30 + a_0.\\]Therefore, the possible values of $k$ are $30, 31, 32, \\ldots, 39$, which sum to \\[30 + 31 + 32 + \\dots + 39 = \\frac{69 \\cdot 10}{2} = 345.\\]\n Adding up both cases, we get the answer, $145 + 345 = \\boxed{490}$.\n *)\n\n\n\ndefinition base_expansion :: \"int \\<Rightarrow> int list \\<Rightarrow> complex\" where\n\"base_expansion n as = sum_list (map (\\<lambda>(i,a). a * ((-n) + \\<i>) ^ i) (enumerate as))\"\n\ndefinition expansions :: \"int set\" where\n\"expansions = {a. \\<exists>as. length as = 4 \\<and> last as \\<noteq> 0 \\<and> set as \\<subseteq> {0..n^2} \\<and> base_expansion n as = a}\"\n\ndefinition sum_expansions :: \"int\" where\n\"sum_expansions = sum id expansions\"\n\nlemma \"sum_expansions = 490\"\n```\n\nThis code is a high-level idea and might need to be adapted depending on the exact capabilities and syntax of your version of Isabelle.
