Isabelle is a theorem proving software, and it is used to prove properties of mathematical objects that can be represented in formal logic. Geometric problems, particularly those involving drawing or visual figures, are not easily translatable into the Isabelle language. However, we can represent part of the problem involving the calculation of the length of the boundary.\n\nHere is a rough translation:\n\n```\ntheorem\nfixes side :: real\nassumes h0 : \"side * side = 81\"\nshows  \"4 * side + 4 * pi * side / 3 = 30.8\"\n```\n\nPlease note that this translation does not fully capture the geometric nature of the problem, but it does represent the calculation of the length of the boundary under the given conditions.\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
