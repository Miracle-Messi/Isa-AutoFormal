For example, June 17 is a relatively prime date because the greatest common factor of 6 and 17 is 1. How many relatively prime dates are in the month with the fewest relatively prime dates? The final Answer is 10\n ### Proof\n Since exactly 1 in every $n$ consecutive dates is divisible by $n$, the month with the fewest relatively prime days is the month with the greatest number of distinct small prime divisors. This reasoning gives us June ($6=2\\cdot3$) and December ($12=2^2\\cdot3$).\n December, however, has one more relatively prime day, namely December 31, than does June, which has only 30 days.\n Therefore, June has the fewest relatively prime days.\n To count how many relatively prime days June has, we must count the number of days that are divisible neither by 2 nor by 3. Out of its 30 days, $\\frac{30}{2}=15$ are divisible by 2 and $\\frac{30}{3}=10$ are divisible by 3.\n We are double counting the number of days that are divisible by 6, $\\frac{30}{6}=5$ days.\n Thus, June has $30-(15+10-5)=30-20=\\boxed{10}$ relatively prime days.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes date :: \"int \\<times> int\"\nassumes h0 : \"\\<forall> (m, d) \\<in> set dates. gcd m d = 1\"\nand h1 : \"dates = [(m, d). m <- [1..12], d <- [1..31]]\"\nshows  \"Min (card {d. \\<exists> m.

        "informal problem": "Consider a set of dates, where each date is a pair of integers representing a month (from 1 to 12) and a day (from 1 to 31). If every date in this set has the property that the greatest common divisor of the month and the day is 1, find the smallest number of unique days that appear in this set. The final answer is 10."
