        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n Two mathematicians were both born in the last 500 years. Each lives (or will live) to be 100 years old, then dies. Each mathematician is equally likely to be born at any point during those 500 years. What is the probability that they were contemporaries for any length of time? The final Answer is \\frac{9}{25}\n ### Proof\n Call the mathematicians Karl and Johann.\n Let the $x$ axis represent the number of years ago Karl was born, and the $y$ axis represent the number of years ago Johann was born.

For example, if Karl was born 200 years ago, Johann could have been born anywhere between 300 and 100 years ago.\n Let 500 years equal one unit.
