        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n The arithmetic progressions $\\{2, 5, 8, 11, \\ldots\\}$ and $\\{3, 10, 17, 24, \\ldots \\}$ have some common values. What is the largest value less than 500 that they have in common? The final Answer is 479\n ### Proof\n Let $a$ be a common term.\n We know that \\begin{align} a&\\equiv 2\\pmod 3\\\\ a&\\equiv 3\\pmod 7 \\end{align} Congruence $(1)$ means that there exists a non-negative integer such that $a=2+3n$.\n Substituting this into $(2)$ yields \\[2+3n\\equiv 3\\pmod 7\\implies n\\equiv 5\\pmod 7\\] So $n$ has a lower bound of $5$. Then $n\\ge 5\\implies a=2+3n\\ge 17$. $17$ satisfies the original congruences, so it is the smallest common term.\n Subtracting $17$ from both sides of both congruences gives \\begin{align} a-17&\\equiv -15\\equiv 0\\pmod 3\\nonumber\\\\ a-17&\\equiv -14\\equiv 0\\pmod 7\\nonumber \\end{align} Since $\\gcd(3,7)$, we get $a-17\\equiv 0\\pmod{3\\cdot 7}$, that is, $a\\equiv 17\\pmod{21}$.\n So all common terms must be of the form $17+21m$ for some non-negative integer $m$.
