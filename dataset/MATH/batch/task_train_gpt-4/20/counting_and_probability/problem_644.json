The final Answer is 438\n ### Proof\n Let the expected value of the number of times Bob rolls his die on a single day be $E$.\n When Bob rolls his die, there is a $\\frac{5}{6}$ chance that he will stop rolling after one roll, and a $\\frac{1}{6}$ chance that he will have to start over. In the second case, since his first roll had no effect on the outcome, Bob will on average roll his die $E$ more times, for a total of $1+E$ times that day.\n Therefore, we know that $E=\\frac{5}{6}(1)+\\frac{1}{6}(1+E)$, or that $E=\\frac{6}{5}$. Over 365 days, Bob will roll his die an average of $\\frac{6}{5}\\cdot365=\\boxed{438}$ times total.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes days :: real and rolls :: real and probability :: \"real \\<Rightarrow> real\"\nassumes h0 : \"days = 365\"\nand h1 : \"probability 1 = 1/6\"\nand h2 : \"probability 2 = 1/6\"\nand h3 : \"probability 3 = 1/6\"\nand h4 : \"probability 4 = 1/6\"\nand h5 : \"probability 5 = 1/6\"\nand h6 : \"probability 6 = 1/6\"\nshows  \"sum (\\<lambda>n. probability n) {1,2,3,4,5,6} * days = 438\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "In a year with 365 days, each day a fair 6-sided die is rolled. The probabilities of getting each number from 1 to 6 are equal (1/6). What is the expected total number of occurrences of all numbers from 1 to 6 throughout the entire year? The final answer is 438."
