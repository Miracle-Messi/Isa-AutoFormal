Then, $\\overline{CD}$ is the remaining segment of $\\overline{AB}$ and takes up $1-1/3 - 1/6 = 1/2$ of the total length of $\\overline{AB}$.\n Thus, if we were to choose a random point on segment $\\overline{AB}$, there would be a $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$ probability that it is between points $C$ and $D$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes A B C D :: real\nassumes h0 : \"A = 0\"\nand h1 : \"B = 12\"\nand h2 : \"D = 4\"\nand h3 : \"C = 10\"\nand h4 : \"B - A = 3 * (D - A) = 6 * (C - B)\"\nshows  \"probability_between_C_and_D = 1/2\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "A line segment has points A, B, C, and D in that order. Point A is at position 0, point B is at position 12, point C is at position 10, and point D is at position 4. The distance between points B and A is three times the distance between points D and A, and six times the distance between points C and B. Find the probability that a randomly chosen point on the line segment lies between points C and D. The final answer is $\\frac{1}{2}$."
