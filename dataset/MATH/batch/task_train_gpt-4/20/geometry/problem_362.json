        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n A delicious circular pie with diameter $12\\text{ cm}$ is cut into three equal-sized sector-shaped pieces. Let $l$ be the number of centimeters in the length of the longest line segment that may be drawn in one of these pieces. What is $l^2$? The final Answer is 108\n ### Proof\n First of all, let us draw one of these pieces in question, labeling points of interest as necessary: [asy] pair pA, pB, pC, pO; pO = (0, 0); pA = dir(150); pB = dir(30); pC = dir(90); draw(pA--pO--pB);\n draw(pA..pC..pB); label(\"$A$\", pA, W); label(\"$B$\", pB, E); label(\"$O$\", pO, S); [/asy] We can see that the longest segment we can draw is from $A$ to $B,$ and to find $AB,$ we should create right triangles by drawing the perpendicular bisector to $AB.$ [asy]\n pair pA, pB, pC, pM, pO; pO = (0, 0); pA = dir(150); pB = dir(30); pC = dir(90); pM = 0.5 * pA + 0.5 * pB; draw(pA--pO--pB); draw(pA--pB); draw(pM--pO); draw(pA..pC..pB); draw(rightanglemark(pO,pM,pA,2));\n label(\"$A$\", pA, W); label(\"$B$\", pB, E); label(\"$O$\", pO, S); label(\"$M$\", pM, N); [/asy] Since $\\angle MOB$ is half of $\\angle AOB,$ which is a third of a full circle, we have $\\angle MOB = 60^\\circ,$ so $\\triangle MOB$ is a 30-60-90 triangle.\n Since the diameter of the pie is $12\\text{ cm},$ we see that $OB = 6\\text{ cm},$ so $MO = 3\\text{ cm}$ and $MB = 3\\sqrt{3}\\text{ cm}.$ Then, $AB = 2 \\cdot MB = 6\\sqrt{3}\\text{ cm},$ so $l = 6\\sqrt{3}.$ Finally, $l^2 = \\boxed{108}.$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes d l :: real\nassumes h0 : \"d = 12\"\nand h1 : \"l = d / sqrt 2\"\nshows  \"l powr 2 = 108\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
