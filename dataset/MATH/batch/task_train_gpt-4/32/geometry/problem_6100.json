        "informal problem": "Given three positive real numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$ such that $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime, there is a region R in the plane. For every point $(x, y)$ in the region R, $ax = by + c$. The region R is divided into two equal areas by a line with a slope of $3$. Find the value of $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$. The final answer is $65$."
