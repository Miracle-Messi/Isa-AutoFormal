For a regular hexagon, the interior angles sum to $180(4)$, so each interior angle has a measure of $\\frac{180(4)}{6}=30\\cdot4=120^\\circ$.\n Since $\\overline{PO}$ and $\\overline{PQ}$ are congruent sides of a regular hexagon, $\\triangle POQ$ is an isosceles triangle.

Since $\\overline{PO}$ and $\\overline{QL}$ are congruent sides of a regular hexagon, trapezoid $PQLO$ is an isosceles trapezoid and the base angles are equal.\n So we know that $x+30=y$. Since the interior angle of a hexagon is $120^\\circ$ and $m\\angle PQO=30^\\circ$, we know that $\\angle OQL$ is a right angle. The acute angles of a right triangle sum to $90^\\circ$, so $x+y=90$.\n Now we can solve for $x$ with $x+(x+30)=90$, which yields $x=30$. The degree measure of $\\angle LOQ$ is $\\boxed{30^\\circ}$. $\\emph{Approach 2}$: We use the fact that trapezoid $LMNO$ is an isosceles trapezoid to solve for $x$.\n Since $\\overline{NO}$ and $\\overline{ML}$ are congruent sides of a regular hexagon, trapezoid $LMNO$ is an isosceles trapezoid and the base angles are equal. The interior angles of a trapezoid sum to $360^\\circ$, so we have $2z+120+120=360$, which yields $z=60$.\n Angle $O$ is an interior angle of a hexagon that measure $120^\\circ$, so $z+x+30=120$.\n We found that $z=60$, so $x=30$.

For a regular hexagon, the interior angles sum to $180(4)$, so each interior angle has a measure of $\\frac{180(4)}{6}=30\\cdot4=120^\\circ$.\n Since $\\overline{PO}$ and $\\overline{PQ}$ are congruent sides of a regular hexagon, $\\triangle POQ$ is an isosceles triangle. The two base angles are congruent and sum to a degree measure of $180-120=60^\\circ$, so each base angle has a measure of $30^\\circ$.\n There are now a couple approaches to finishing the problem. $\\emph{Approach 1}$: We use the fact that trapezoid $PQLO$ is an isosceles trapezoid to solve for $x$ and $y$. Since $\\overline{PO}$ and $\\overline{QL}$ are congruent sides of a regular hexagon, trapezoid $PQLO$ is an isosceles trapezoid and the base angles are equal.\n So we know that $x+30=y$. Since the interior angle of a hexagon is $120^\\circ$ and $m\\angle PQO=30^\\circ$, we know that $\\angle OQL$ is a right angle. The acute angles of a right triangle sum to $90^\\circ$, so $x+y=90$.\n Now we can solve for $x$ with $x+(x+30)=90$, which yields $x=30$. The degree measure of $\\angle LOQ$ is $\\boxed{30^\\circ}$. $\\emph{Approach 2}$: We use the fact that trapezoid $LMNO$ is an isosceles trapezoid to solve for $x$.\n Since $\\overline{NO}$ and $\\overline{ML}$ are congruent sides of a regular hexagon, trapezoid $LMNO$ is an isosceles trapezoid and the base angles are equal. The interior angles of a trapezoid sum to $360^\\circ$, so we have $2z+120+120=360$, which yields $z=60$.\n Angle $O$ is an interior angle of a hexagon that measure $120^\\circ$, so $z+x+30=120$.\n We found that $z=60$, so $x=30$.

For a regular hexagon, the interior angles sum to $180(4)$, so each interior angle has a measure of $\\frac{180(4)}{6}=30\\cdot4=120^\\circ$.\n Since $\\overline{PO}$ and $\\overline{PQ}$ are congruent sides of a regular hexagon, $\\triangle POQ$ is an isosceles triangle. The two base angles are congruent and sum to a degree measure of $180-120=60^\\circ$, so each base angle has a measure of $30^\\circ$.\n There are now a couple approaches to finishing the problem. $\\emph{Approach 1}$: We use the fact that trapezoid $PQLO$ is an isosceles trapezoid to solve for $x$ and $y$. Since $\\overline{PO}$ and $\\overline{QL}$ are congruent sides of a regular hexagon, trapezoid $PQLO$ is an isosceles trapezoid and the base angles are equal.\n So we know that $x+30=y$. Since the interior angle of a hexagon is $120^\\circ$ and $m\\angle PQO=30^\\circ$, we know that $\\angle OQL$ is a right angle. The acute angles of a right triangle sum to $90^\\circ$, so $x+y=90$.\n Now we can solve for $x$ with $x+(x+30)=90$, which yields $x=30$. The degree measure of $\\angle LOQ$ is $\\boxed{30^\\circ}$. $\\emph{Approach 2}$: We use the fact that trapezoid $LMNO$ is an isosceles trapezoid to solve for $x$.\n Since $\\overline{NO}$ and $\\overline{ML}$ are congruent sides of a regular hexagon, trapezoid $LMNO$ is an isosceles trapezoid and the base angles are equal. The interior angles of a trapezoid sum to $360^\\circ$, so we have $2z+120+120=360$, which yields $z=60$.\n Angle $O$ is an interior angle of a hexagon that measure $120^\\circ$, so $z+x+30=120$.\n We found that $z=60$, so $x=30$. The degree measure of $\\angle LOQ$ is $\\boxed{30^\\circ}$.
