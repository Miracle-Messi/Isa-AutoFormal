Indeed, construct the perpendiculars from the vertices of the shorter base to the longer base. This splits the trapezoid into a rectangle and two triangles; it also splits the desired line segment into three partitions with lengths $x_1, 75, x_2$.\n By similar triangles, we easily find that $\\frac{x - 75}{100} = \\frac{x_1+x_2}{100} = \\frac{h_1}{h}$, as desired.

        "informal problem": "Let x be a positive real number. Consider two numbers a and b, where a is equal to x plus 100 and b is equal to x. Let h be the square root of 9 times a times b divided by 5. If twice of the sum of a and b times h equals 5 times the square of x, find the floor of the quotient of the square of x divided by 100. The final answer is 181."
