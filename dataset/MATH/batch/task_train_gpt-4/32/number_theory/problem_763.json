If we let $10a+b$ represent the last number, where $a$ and $b$ are the tens and units digits, respectively, then the sum of the four numbers is $142+10a+b$.\n The sum of the digits of the first three numbers is $5+7+1+3+7+2=25$, so the total sum of the digits is $25+a+b$. If we multiply the sum of the digits by 5, we should get the sum of the four numbers. \\begin{align}\n 142+10a+b&=5(25+a+b)\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\ &=125+5a+5b\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\ 17+5a&=4b \\end{align} We notice that if we add a multiple of 5 to 17, the ones digit will either be 2 or 7. The next multiple of 4 that is greater than 17 and ends with a 2 or 7 is 32.\n That means $b=8$, while $17+5a=32$, so $5a=15$ and $a=3$.\n So the last number is $\\boxed{38}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes lucky_number :: nat\nassumes h0 : \"lucky_number \\<ge> 10\"\nand h1 : \"lucky_number \\<le> 99\"\nand h2 : \"(5 * (digit_sum 57 + digit_sum 13 + digit_sum 72 + digit_sum lucky_number)) = (57 + 13 + 72 + lucky_number)\"\nshows  \"lucky_number = 38\"\nwhere \n\"digit_sum n = (n mod 10) + (n div 10)\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "Find a two-digit lucky number such that when you add the sum of the digits of the numbers 57, 13, 72, and this lucky number and multiply the result by 5, you get the sum of the actual numbers 57, 13, 72, and the lucky number. The final answer is 38."
