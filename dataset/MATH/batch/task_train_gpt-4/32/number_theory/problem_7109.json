        "informal problem": "Assume we have a positive integer $n$. We denote two sets of divisors of $n$ as follows:\n- $divisors_{110n3}$ contains all positive divisors $d$ of $110n^3$.\n- $divisors_{81n4}$ contains all positive divisors $d$ of $81n^4$.\n\nIf the cardinality (the number of elements) of $divisors_{110n3}$ equals $110$, find the cardinality of $divisors_{81n4}$. The final answer is $325$."
