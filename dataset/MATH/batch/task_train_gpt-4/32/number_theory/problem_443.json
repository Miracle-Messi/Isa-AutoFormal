If $n\\leq 28$, then $S(n)\\leq S(28)=10$.\n Therefore if $n$ satisfies the required condition it must also satisfy \\[ n\\geq 2007-28-10=1969. \\] In addition, $n,S(n),\\text{ and }S(S(n))$ all leave the same remainder when divided by 9. Because 2007 is a multiple of 9, it follows that $n,S(n),\\text{ and }S(S(n))$ must all be multiples of 3.\n The required condition is satisfied by $\\boxed{4}$ multiples of 3 between 1969 and 2007, namely 1977, 1980, 1983, and 2001. Note: There appear to be many cases to check, that is, all the multiples of 3 between 1969 and 2007.\n However, for $1987\\leq n\\leq 1999$, we have $n+S(n)\\geq 1990+19=2009$, so these numbers are eliminated.\n Thus we need only check 1971, 1974, 1977, 1980, 1983, 1986, 2001, and 2004.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes n :: nat and S :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> nat\"\nassumes h0 : \"\\<forall> n. n > 0 \\<longrightarrow> S n = sum (digits n)\"\nshows  \"card {n. n + S n + S (S n) = 2007} = 4\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "Find how many natural numbers $n$ satisfy the equation $n + S(n) + S(S(n)) = 2007$, where $S(n)$ is the sum of the digits of $n$. The final answer is 4."
