What was the total number of players in the tournament?\n The final Answer is 25\n ### Proof\n Let us suppose for convenience that there were $n + 10$ players overall. Among the $n$ players not in the weakest 10 there were $n \\choose 2$ games played and thus $n \\choose 2$ points earned.\n By the givens, this means that these $n$ players also earned $n \\choose 2$ points against our weakest 10.\n Now, the 10 weakest players playing amongst themselves played ${10 \\choose 2} = 45$ games and so earned 45 points playing each other. Then they also earned 45 points playing against the stronger $n$ players.\n Since every point earned falls into one of these categories, It follows that the total number of points earned was $2{n \\choose 2} + 90 = n^2 - n + 90$.\n However, there was one point earned per game, and there were a total of ${n + 10 \\choose 2} = \\frac{(n + 10)(n + 9)}{2}$ games played and thus $\\frac{(n + 10)(n + 9)}{2}$ points earned.\n So we have $n^2 -n + 90 = \\frac{(n + 10)(n + 9)}{2}$ so $2n^2 - 2n + 180 = n^2 + 19n + 90$ and $n^2 -21n + 90 = 0$ and $n = 6$ or $n = 15$.\n Now, note that the top $n$ players got $n(n - 1)$ points in total (by our previous calculation) for an average of $n - 1$, while the bottom 10 got 90 points total, for an average of 9.\n Thus we must have $n > 10$, so $n = 15$ and the answer is $15 + 10 = \\boxed{25}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes total_players::nat\nassumes h0 : \"\\<forall>p. \\<exists>n. p > 10 \\<longrightarrow> points p = 2 * (\\<Sum>q \\<in> {1..10}. points_against p q)\"\nand h1 : \"\\<forall>p. \\<exists>n. p \\<in> {1..10} \\<longrightarrow> points p = (\\<Sum>q \\<in> ({1..10} - {p}). points_against p q)\"\nand h2 : \"points p = (\\<Sum>q \\<in> {1..total_players} - {p}. points_against p q)\"\nand h3 : \"total_games = total_players * (total_players - 1) div 2\"\nand h4 : \"total_points = total_games\"\nshows  \"total_players = 25\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
