        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n The increasing sequence $1,3,4,9,10,12,13\\cdots$ consists of all those positive integers which are powers of 3 or sums of distinct powers of 3. Find the $100^{\\mbox{th}}$ term of this sequence.\n The final Answer is 981\n ### Proof\n Rewrite all of the terms in base 3. Since the numbers are sums of distinct powers of 3, in base 3 each number is a sequence of 1s and 0s (if there is a 2, then it is no longer the sum of distinct powers of 3).\n Therefore, we can recast this into base 2 (binary) in order to determine the 100th number. $100$ is equal to $64 + 32 + 4$, so in binary form we get $1100100$.\n However, we must change it back to base 10 for the answer, which is $3^6 + 3^5 + 3^2 = 729 + 243 + 9 = \\boxed{981}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes f :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> nat\"\nassumes h0 : \"f 1 = 1\"\nand h1 : \"f 2 = 3\"\nand h2 : \"f 3 = 4\"\nand h3 : \"f 4 = 9\"\nand h4 : \"f 5 = 10\"\nand h5 : \"f 6 = 12\"\nand h6 : \"f 7 = 13\"\nand h7 : \"\\<forall>n. n > 7 \\<longrightarrow> f n = (if n mod 2 = 0 then f (n div 2) * 3 else f (n div 2) * 3 + 1)\"\nshows  \"f 100 = 981\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "The function $f$ is defined on the natural numbers as follows: $f(1) = 1, f(2) = 3, f(3) = 4, f(4) = 9, f(5) = 10, f(6) = 12, f(7) = 13$. For all $n > 7$, $f(n)$ is defined as three times the value of $f$ at half $n$ if $n$ is even, and three times the value of $f$ at half $n$ plus one if $n$ is odd. What is the value of $f(100)$? The final answer is $981$."
