The final Answer is 9:24\n ### Proof\n We know that they will meet some time $T$ after 8:00 and that $T$ must be a multiple of 4, 7, and 6.\n So our job is to find the smallest multiple of those three numbers. Since 4 and 7 share no factors, the first number that is a multiple of both will be $4\\cdot7=28$. Next, we must find the smallest multiple of 28 and 6.\n We can do this in two ways: by listing multiples of 28 until we find one that is a multiple of 6 or by finding what factors of 6 that 28 is missing and multiplying by those factors. Method 1: The multiples of 28 go 28 (not divisible by 6), 56 (not divisible by 6), 84 (which is divisible by 6!)...\n So the smallest multiple of 4, 7, and 6 is 84. Method 2: The factors of 6 are 1,2,3, and 6, so we can write 6 as $2\\cdot3$. 28 is divisible by 2 but not by 3, so we must multiply it by 3.\n We find $28\\cdot3=84$ and 84 is therefore the smallest multiple of 4, 7, and 6.\n Now we just need to find the time that is 84 minutes after 8:00. Since 9:00 is 60 minutes after 8:00, we just need 24 more minutes after that (since $60+24=84$). The final time is therefore $\\boxed{9:24}.$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes a b c :: real\nassumes h0 : \"a = 4\"\nand h1 : \"b = 7\"\nand h2 : \"c = 6\"\nshows  \"lcm (lcm a b) c = 84\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
