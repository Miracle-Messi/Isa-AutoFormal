        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n The graph of the parabola defined by the equation $y=(x-2)^2+3$ is rotated 180 degrees about its vertex, then shifted 3 units to the left, then shifted 2 units down. The resulting parabola has zeros at $x=a$ and $x=b$. What is $a+b$? The final Answer is -2\n ### Proof\n The graph of the original parabola ($A$) and its final image ($A'$) after rotation and translation is shown below: [asy] Label f; f.p=fontsize(4); xaxis(-3,4,Ticks(f, 2.0)); yaxis(-3,7,Ticks(f, 2.0)); real f(real x)\n { return (x-2)^2+3; } draw(\"$A$\", graph(f,0,4), linewidth(1)); real g(real x) { return -(x+1)^2+1; } draw(\"$A'$\", graph(g,-3,1), linewidth(1)); [/asy] Rotating the original parabola 180 degrees changes its equation to $y=-(x-2)^2+3$.\n Shifting this last parabola to the left changes its equation to $y=-(x+1)^2+3$. Shifting it down changes its equation to $y=-(x+1)^2+1$.\n So the equation of $A'$ is $y=-(x+1)^2+1$.\n To find the zeros of this parabola, we set $y=0$ to get $0=-(x+1)^2+1$.\n Expanding the right hand side gives $0=-x^2-2x$.\n Dividing through by $-1$ and factoring out an $x$ from the right hand side, we get $0=x(x+2)$, so either $x=0$ or $x+2=0$.\n Thus, $a=0$ and $b=-2$, so $a+b=\\boxed{-2}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes a b :: real and y :: \"real \\<Rightarrow> real\"\nassumes h0 : \"\\<forall>x. y x = (x - 2) powr 2 + 3\"\nand h1 : \"y a = 0\"\nand h2 : \"y b = 0\"\nshows  \"a + b = -2\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
