What is the average speed of the car, in kph? The final Answer is 51\n ### Proof\n To find the average speed for the entire trip, we need to divide the total distance by the total time. Remembering that $d=r\\cdot t$, and looking at each of the four parts of the trip, these pieces can be determined.\n First, a car traveling at 40 kph for 20 km will be traveling for $20/40=.5$ hours. Next, a car traveling at 50 kph for 25 km will be traveling for $25/50=.5$ hours. Next, a car traveling at 60 kph for 45 minutes (.75 hours) will travel a total of $60\\times .75=45$ km during that time.\n Finally, a car traveling 48 kph for 15 minutes (.25 hours) will travel a total of $48\\times .25=12$ km.
