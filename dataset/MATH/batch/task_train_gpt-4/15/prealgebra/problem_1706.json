        "informal problem": "Given that the price of a carrot is $1, the price of milk is $3, the price of a pineapple is $4, the price of flour is $5, and the price of ice cream is $7. If you have 5 carrots, 3 milk, 2 pineapples, 2 flour, and one ice cream, and you have a coupon of $5. The total price is calculated by adding up the cost of all items and then subtracting the coupon. If the pineapple is on sale for half price, what is the new total price after adjusting for the sale price of the pineapple? The final answer is $30."
