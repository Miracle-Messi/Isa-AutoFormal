        "informal problem": "Given three points A, B, and C on a plane, where the x-coordinate of A is 3 more than the y-coordinate of A, the x-coordinate of B is twice the y-coordinate of B plus 4, and the distance between A and B is 60 units. The distance from C to A is the square root of the difference between the square of the distance from A to B and the square of the distance from C to B. If the area of the triangle formed by A, B, and C is half the product of the distance from C to A and the distance from C to B, find the area of the triangle. The final answer is 400 square units."
