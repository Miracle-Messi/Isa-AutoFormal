At meetings, committee members sit at a round table with chairs numbered from $1$ to $15$ in clockwise order. Committee rules state that a Martian must occupy chair $1$ and an Earthling must occupy chair $15$, Furthermore, no Earthling can sit immediately to the left of a Martian, no Martian can sit immediately to the left of a Venusian, and no Venusian can sit immediately to the left of an Earthling. The number of possible seating arrangements for the committee is $N \\cdot (5!)^3$. Find $N$.\n The final Answer is 346\n ### Proof\n Since the 5 members of each planet committee are distinct we get that the number of arrangement of sittings is in the form $N*(5! )^3$ because for each $M, V, E$ sequence we have $5!$ arrangements within the Ms, Vs, and Es.\n Pretend the table only seats $3$ \"people\", with $1$ \"person\" from each planet. Counting clockwise, only the arrangement M, V, E satisfies the given constraints.\n Therefore, in the actual problem, the members must sit in cycles of M, V, E, but not necessarily with one M, one V, and one E in each cycle(for example, MMVVVE, MVVVEEE, MMMVVVEE all count as cycles). These cycles of MVE must start at seat $1$, since an M is at seat $1$.\n We simply count the number of arrangements through casework. 1.

Two cycles - There are 3 Ms, Vs and Es left to distribute among the existing MVEMVE.\n Using stars and bars, we get $\\binom{4}{1}=4$ ways for the members of each planet.\n Therefore, there are $4^3=64$ ways in total. 3. Three cycles - 2 Ms, Vs, Es left, so $\\binom{4}{2}=6$, making there $6^3=216$ ways total. 4.
