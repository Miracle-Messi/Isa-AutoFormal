Given that 1 belongs to $\\mathcal{S}$ and that 2002 is the largest element of $\\mathcal{S},$ what is the greatest number of elements that $\\mathcal{S}$ can have?\n The final Answer is 30\n ### Proof\n Let the sum of the integers in $\\mathcal{S}$ be $N$, and let the size of $|\\mathcal{S}|$ be $n+1$. After any element $x$ is removed, we are given that $n|N-x$, so $x\\equiv N\\pmod{n}$. Since $1\\in\\mathcal{S}$, $N\\equiv1\\pmod{n}$, and all elements are congruent to 1 mod $n$.\n Since they are positive integers, the largest element is at least $n^2+1$, the $(n+1)$th positive integer congruent to 1 mod $n$.\n We are also given that this largest member is 2002, so $2002\\equiv1\\pmod{n}$, and $n|2001=3\\cdot23\\cdot29$. Also, we have $n^2+1\\le2002$, so $n<45$. The largest factor of 2001 less than 45 is 29, so $n=29$ and $n+1$ $\\Rightarrow{\\boxed{30}}$ is the largest possible.\n This can be achieved with $\\mathcal{S}=\\{1,30,59,88,\\ldots,813,2002\\}$, for instance.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes S :: \"int set\"\nand avg :: \"int set \\<Rightarrow> int\"\nassumes h0 : \"\\<forall> x \\<in> S. x > 0 \\<and> avg (S - {x}) \\<in> \\<nat>\"\nand h1 : \"1 \\<in> S\"\nand h2 : \"Max S = 2002\"\nshows  \"card S \\<le> 30\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "Consider a set of positive integers $S$ such that for each element $x$ in $S$, the average of the elements in the set $S$ excluding $x$ is a natural number. Also, the set $S$ contains the number 1 and the maximum element in $S$ is 2002. What is the maximum possible number of elements that $S$ can have? The answer is 30."
