The final Answer is 505\n ### Proof\n First consider the points in the six parallelepipeds projecting 1 unit outward from the original parallelepiped. Two of these six parallelepipeds are 1 by 3 by 4, two are 1 by 3 by 5, and two are 1 by 4 by 5.\n The sum of their volumes is $2(1\\cdot3\\cdot4+1\\cdot3\\cdot5+1\\cdot4\\cdot5)=94$. Next consider the points in the twelve quarter-cylinders of radius 1 whose heights are the edges of the original parallelepiped.\n The sum of their volumes is $4\\cdot{1\\over4}\\pi\\cdot1^2(3+4+5)=12\\pi$. Finally, consider the points in the eight octants of a sphere of radius 1 at the eight vertices of the original parallelepiped. The sum of their volumes is $8\\cdot{1\\over8}\\cdot{4\\over3}\\pi\\cdot1^3={{4\\pi}\\over3}$.\n Because the volume of the original parallelepiped is $3\\cdot4\\cdot 5=60$, the requested volume is $60+94+12\\pi+4\\pi/3=\\displaystyle {{462+40\\pi}\\over3}$, so $m+n+p=462+40+3=\\boxed{505}$.
