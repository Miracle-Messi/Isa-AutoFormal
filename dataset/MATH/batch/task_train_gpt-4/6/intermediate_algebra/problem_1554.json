        "informal problem": "Given an ellipse and a triangle, the product of the lengths of two axes of the ellipse is equal to the third length. The third length is 6 units. Furthermore, the triangle is inscribed in the ellipse and the diameter of the inscribed circle of the triangle is 2 units. What is the product of the lengths of the other two sides of the ellipse? The final answer is 65."
