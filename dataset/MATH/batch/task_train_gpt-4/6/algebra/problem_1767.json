        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n A $100$-gon $P_1$ is drawn in the Cartesian plane.  The sum of the $x$-coordinates of the $100$ vertices equals 2009.  The midpoints of the sides of $P_1$ form a second $100$-gon, $P_2$.  Finally, the midpoints of the sides of $P_2$ form a third $100$-gon, $P_3$.  Find the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the vertices of $P_3$. The final Answer is 2009\n ### Proof\n Let the $x$-coordinates of the vertices of $P_1$ be $x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_{100}$. Then, by the midpoint formula, the $x$-coordinates of the vertices of $P_2$ are $\\frac{x_1+x_2}2,\\frac{x_2+x_3}2,\\ldots,\\frac{x_{100}+x_1}2 $.\n The sum of these equals $\\frac{2x_1+2x_2+\\cdots +2x_{100}}2=x_1+x_2+\\cdots+x_{100}$.\n Similarly, the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the vertices of $P_3$ equals the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the vertices of  $P_2$.\n Thus the desired answer is $\\boxed{2009}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes sum_x_P1 sum_x_P2 sum_x_P3 :: real\nassumes h0 : \"sum_x_P1 = 2009\"\nand h1 : \"sum_x_P2 = sum_x_P1\"\nand h2 : \"sum_x_P3 = sum_x_P2\"\nshows  \"sum_x_P3 = 2009\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
