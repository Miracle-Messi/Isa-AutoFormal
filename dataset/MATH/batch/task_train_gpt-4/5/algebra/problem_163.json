        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n The quadratic equation $ax^2+20x+c=0$ has exactly one solution. If $a+c=29$, and $a<c$ find the ordered pair $(a,c)$. The final Answer is (4,25)\n ### Proof\n Since the quadratic has only one solution, the discriminant must be equal to zero. The discriminant is $b^2-4ac=400-4ac=0$, so $ac=\\frac{400}{4}=100$.\n We need to find $a$ and $c$ given $a+c=29$ and $ac=100$.\n We could write a quadratic equation and solve, but instead we rely on clever algebraic manipulations: Since $a+c=29$, we have $$(a+c)^2=a^2+c^2+2ac=29^2=841.$$We subtract $4ac=400$ from each side to find $$a^2+c^2+2ac-4ac=a^2+c^2-2ac=841-400=441.$$We recognize each side as a square, so we take the square root of both sides: $$\\sqrt{a^2+c^2-2ac}=\\sqrt{(c-a)^2}=c-a=\\sqrt{441}=21.$$(Technically we should take the positive and negative square root of both sides, but since $c>a$ we know $c-a>0$.)\n Thus we have  \\begin{align} c-a&=21\\\\ c+a&=29 \\end{align}Summing these equations gives \\begin{align} 2c&=50\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad c&=25, \\end{align}and $a=29-c=4$.\n Thus our ordered pair $(a,c)$ is $\\boxed{(4,25)}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes a c :: real and x :: \"real \\<Rightarrow> real\"\nassumes h0 : \"a + c = 29\"\nand h1 : \"a < c\"\nand h2 : \"\\<forall> x. a * x powr 2 + 20 * x + c = 0\"\nand h3 : \"card {x. x * a powr 2 + 20 * x + c = 0} = 1\"\nshows  \"a = 4 \\<and> c = 25\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
