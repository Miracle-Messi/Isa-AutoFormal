If the line $y=mx+b$ passes through the point $(1,6)$, and $b\\neq 0$, find the equation of the line.  Enter your answer in the form \"$y = mx + b$\". The final Answer is y=10x-4\n ### Proof\n The line $x=k$ intersects $y=x^2+6x+5$ at the point $(k, k^2+6k+5)$ and the line $y=mx+b$ at the point $(k,mk+b)$. Since these two points have the same $x$-coordinate, the distance between them is the difference of their $y$-coordinates, so we have $$|(k^2+6k+5)-(mk+b)|=5.$$ Simplifying, this gives us two quadratic equations: $k^2+(6-m)k+5-b=5$ and $k^2+(6-m)k+5-b=-5$.\n We can express these as  \\begin{align} k^2+(6-m)k-b=0&\\quad(1)\\\\ k^2+(6-m)k+10-b=0.&\\quad(2) \\end{align} We know that all solutions to both of these equations will be places where the line $y=mx+b$ is a vertical distance of $5$ from the parabola, but we know there can only be one such solution!\n Thus there must be exactly $1$ solution to one of the equations, and no solutions to the other equation.\n We find the discriminants ($b^2-4ac$) of the equations, so for equation $(1)$ the discriminant is $(6-m)^2-4(1)(-b)=(6-m)^2+4b$. For equation $(2)$ the discriminant is $(6-m)^2-4(1)(10-b)=(6-m)^2+4b-40$.\n One of these equations must equal zero, and one must be less than zero. Since $-40<0$, adding $(6-m)^2+4b$ to both sides doesn't change the inequality and $(6-m)^2+4b-40<(6-m)^2+4b$, so the greater value must be equal to zero so that the lesser value is always less than zero.\n Thus we have $(6-m)^2+4b=0$.\n We are also given that the line $y=mx+b$ passes through the point $(1,6)$, so substituting $x=1$ and $y=6$ gives $6=(1)m+b$ or $m+b=6$. This means that $6-m=b$, so we can substitute in the above equation: \\begin{align}\n (6-m)^2+4b&=0\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\ (b)^2+4b&=0\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\ b(b+4)&=0. \\end{align} We are given that $b\\neq 0$, so the only solution is $b=-4$.\n When we plug this into the equation $m+b=6$, we find $m-4=6$ so $m=10$.\n Thus the equation of the line is $y=mx+b$ or $\\boxed{y=10x-4}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes k m b :: real and line1 line2 :: \"real \\<Rightarrow> real\"\nassumes h0 : \"\\<forall>x. line1 x = x powr 2 + 6 * x + 5\"\nand h1 : \"\\<forall>x. line2 x = m * x + b\"\nand h2 : \"b \\<noteq> 0\"\nand h3 : \"line2 1 = 6\"\nand h4 : \"card {x. line1 x = line2 x \\<and> (\\<exists> x'. line1 x' = line2 x' \\<and> x \\<noteq> x' \\<and> sqrt ((x - x') powr 2 + (line1 x - line1 x') powr 2) = 5)} = 1\"\nshows  \"line2 x = 10 * x - 4\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
