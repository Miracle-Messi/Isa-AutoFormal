The final Answer is (3+\\sqrt{5},-1)\n ### Proof\n We see that the endpoints of the major axis of the ellipse are $(0,-1)$ and $(6,-1)$, and the endpoints of the minor axis of the ellipse are $(3,1)$ and $(3,-3)$. Then, the center of the ellipse is the midpoint of the two axes, which is $(3,-1)$.\n The lengths of the major and minor axis are $6$ and $4$, respectively, so the distance between the foci is $\\sqrt{6^2-4^2} = 2\\sqrt{5}.$ It follows that each focus is $\\sqrt{5}$ away from the center, $(3,-1),$ along the major (horizontal) axis.\n Therefore, the focus with the larger $x$-coordinate must be $\\boxed{(3+\\sqrt{5},-1)}.$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes x y :: real\nassumes h0 : \"((x - 3) powr 2 / 2 powr 2) + ((y + 1) powr 2 / 3 powr 2) = 1\"\nshows  \"x = 3 + sqrt 5 \\<and> y = -1\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
