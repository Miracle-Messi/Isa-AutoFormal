The angle, $\\angle BAC$, therefore can be expressed as: \\[360^\\circ - \\frac{900}{7}^\\circ - 90^\\circ = 270^\\circ - \\frac{900}{7}^\\circ = \\frac{1890 - 900}{7}^\\circ = \\boxed{\\frac{990}{7}^\\circ}.\\]\n *)\n\nThis problem involves a diagram and geometric calculations, which are beyond the capabilities of Isabelle to directly represent.

        "informal problem": "The original problem statement isn't provided, but based on the context, it seems like the problem could involve understanding and calculating the exterior angles of regular polygons. For instance, the problem could be \"What is the exterior angle of a regular polygon with 'n' sides, given that 'n' is greater than 2?\" The answer would be \"The exterior angle of a regular polygon with 'n' sides is equal to 360/n degrees.\"\n\nIt's also mentioned that the problem involves a square and a heptagon sharing a side and the calculation of a certain angle BAC. However, without the full context or a diagram, it's difficult to translate this portion into a natural language problem."
