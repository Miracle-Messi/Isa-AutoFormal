In any of its 6 matches, the probabilities that Club Truncator will win, lose, or tie are each $\\frac {1}{3}$. The probability that Club Truncator will finish the season with more wins than losses is $\\frac {m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$.\n The final Answer is 341\n ### Proof\n Note that the probability that Club Truncator will have more wins than losses is equal to the probability that it will have more losses than wins; the only other possibility is that they have the same number of wins and losses.\n Thus, by the complement principle, the desired probability is half the probability that Club Truncator does not have the same number of wins and losses. The possible ways to achieve the same number of wins and losses are $0$ ties, $3$ wins and $3$ losses; $2$ ties, $2$ wins, and $2$ losses; $4$ ties, $1$ win, and $1$ loss; or $6$ ties.\n Since there are $6$ games, there are $\\frac{6!}{3!3! }$ ways for the first, and $\\frac{6!}{2!2!2! }$, $\\frac{6!}{4! }$, and $1$ ways for the rest, respectively, out of a total of $3^6$. This gives a probability of $141/729$.\n Then the desired answer is $\\frac{1 - \\frac{141}{729}}{2} = \\frac{98}{243}$, so the answer is $m+n = \\boxed{341}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes wins losses ties :: nat and P :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> nat \\<Rightarrow> nat \\<Rightarrow> real\"\nassumes h0 : \"P wins losses ties = (1/3)^6 * (fact 6) / (fact wins * fact losses * fact ties)\"\nand h1 : \"wins + losses + ties = 6\"\nand h2 : \"gcd m n = 1\"\nand h3 : \"wins > losses\"\nshows  \"(\\<Sum>(wins, losses, ties)\\<in>{(wins, losses, ties). wins + losses + ties = 6 \\<and> wins > losses}.

        "informal problem": "In a sports league, a team played a total of 6 games. They won some games, lost some games, and tied in some games. The probability of each possible outcome (wins, losses, and ties) can be calculated using the formula $P(w, l, t) = \\frac{1}{3^6} \\cdot \\frac{6!}{w! \\cdot l! \\cdot t!}$, where $w$, $l$, and $t$ represent the number of wins, losses, and ties, respectively. The team won more games than they lost. Calculate the sum of the probabilities for all possible outcomes where the team won more games than they lost, and express the sum as a fraction $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are coprime integers. Find the value of $m + n$. The final answer is 341."
