If all of the math textbooks are put into the box that can hold $4$ textbooks, there are $9$ ways to choose the other book in that box, times $8\\textbf{C}3$ ways for the other books to be arranged.\n If all of the math textbooks are put into the box with the capability of holding $5$ textbooks, there are $9\\textbf{C}2$ ways to choose the other 2 textbooks in that box, times $7\\textbf{C}3$ ways to arrange the other 7 textbooks.\n $9\\textbf{C}4=9\\cdot7\\cdot2=126$, $9\\cdot 8\\textbf{C}3=9\\cdot8\\cdot7=504$, and $9\\textbf{C}2\\cdot 7\\textbf{C}3=9\\cdot7\\cdot5\\cdot4=1260$, so the total number of ways the math textbooks can all be placed into the same box is $126+504+1260=1890$.\n So, the probability of this occurring is $\\frac{(9\\cdot7)(2+8+(4\\cdot5))}{12\\cdot11\\cdot10\\cdot7\\cdot3}=\\frac{1890}{27720}$. If the numerator and denominator are both divided by $9\\cdot7$, we have $\\frac{(2+8+(4\\cdot5))}{4\\cdot11\\cdot10}=\\frac{30}{440}$.\n Simplifying the numerator yields $\\frac{30}{10\\cdot4\\cdot11}$, and dividing both numerator and denominator by $10$ results in $\\frac{3}{44}$.
