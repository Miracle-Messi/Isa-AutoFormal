Find $a+b$. The final Answer is 12\n ### Proof\n By the distance formula, we are trying to minimize $\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=\\sqrt{x^2+(1/2)(x^4-6x^2+9)}$. In general, minimization problems like this require calculus, but one optimization method that sometimes works is to try to complete the square.\n Pulling out a factor of $1/2$ from under the radical, we have \\begin{align} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\sqrt{2x^2+x^4-6x^2+9}&=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\sqrt{(x^4-4x^2+4)+5} \\\\ &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\sqrt{(x^2-2)^2+5}.\n \\end{align}This last expression is minimized when the square equals $0$, i.e. when $x=\\sqrt{2}$. Then the distance is $\\sqrt{5}/\\sqrt{2}=\\sqrt{10}/2$.\n Hence the desired answer is $\\boxed{12}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes x y a b :: real\nassumes h0 : \"y = (1 / sqrt 2) * (x powr 2 - 3)\"\nand h1 : \"smallest_distance (0,0) (x,y) = sqrt a / b\"\nand h2 : \"a > 0\"\nand h3 : \"b > 0\"\nand h4 : \"a \\<notin> {k powr 2 |k. k > 1}\"\nshows  \"a + b = 12\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
