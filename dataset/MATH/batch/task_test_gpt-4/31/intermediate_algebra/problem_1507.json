Let $a_n$ be the greatest term in this sequence that is less than 1000.  Find $n+a_n$. The final Answer is 973\n ### Proof\n Let $r = a_2.$  Then the first few terms are \\begin{align} a_1 &= 1, \\\\ a_2 &= r, \\\\ a_3 &= \\frac{a_2^2}{a_1} = r^2, \\\\ a_4 &= 2a_3 - a_2 = 2r^2 - r = r(2r - 1), \\\\ a_5 &= \\frac{a_4^2}{a_3} = \\frac{r^2 (2r - 1)^2}{r^2} = (2r - 1)^2, \\\\\n a_6 &= 2a_5 - a_4 = (2r - 1)^2 - r(2r - 1) = (2r - 1)(3r - 2), \\\\ a_7 &= \\frac{a_6^2}{a_5} = \\frac{(2r - 1)^2 (3r - 2)^2}{(2r - 1)^2} = (3r - 2)^2, \\\\ a_8 &= 2a_7 - a_6 = 2(3r - 2)^2 - (2r - 1)(3r - 2) = (3r - 2)(4r - 3), \\\\\n a_9 &= \\frac{a_8^2}{a_7} = \\frac{(3r - 2)^2 (4r - 3)^2}{(3r - 2)^2} = (4r - 3)^2, \\\\ a_{10} &= 2a_9 - a_8 = 2(4r - 3)^2 - (3r - 2)(4r - 3) = (4r - 3)(5r - 4). \\end{align}and so on. More generally, we can prove by induction that\n \\begin{align} a_{2k} &= [(k - 1)r - (k - 2)][kr - (k - 1)], \\\\ a_{2k + 1} &= [kr - (k - 1)]^2 \\end{align}for any positive integer $k.$ Then $(4r - 3)^2 + (4r - 3)(5r - 4) = 646.$  This simplifies to $36r^2 - 55r - 625 = 0,$ which factors as $(r - 5)(36r + 125) = 0.$  Hence, $r = 5.$\n Then using the formulas above, we can compute that $a_{16} = 957$ and $a_{17} = 1089,$ so the final answer is $16 + 957 = \\boxed{973}.$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes a :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> nat\"\nassumes h0 : \"a 1 = 1\"\nand h1 : \"a 9 + a 10 = 646\"\nand h2 : \"\\<forall> n. n \\<ge> 1 \\<longrightarrow> a (2*n - 1) * a (2*n + 1) = (a (2*n)) powr 2\"\nand h3 : \"\\<forall> n. n \\<ge> 1 \\<longrightarrow> a (2*n) + a (2*n + 2) = 2 * a (2*n + 1)\"\nand h4 : \"Max {a n |n. a n < 1000} = a k for some k\"\nshows  \"k + a k = 973\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",

The sequence also satisfies the following properties:\n\n- For every natural number $n \\geq 1$, the product of the $(2n - 1)$th and $(2n + 1)$th terms equals the square of the $2n$th term.\n- For every natural number $n \\geq 1$, the sum of the $2n$th and $(2n + 2)$th terms equals twice the $(2n + 1)$th term.\n\nFurthermore, let $k$ be such that $a(k)$ is the maximum term in the sequence that is less than 1000. \n\nFind the sum of $k + a(k)$. The final answer is 973."
