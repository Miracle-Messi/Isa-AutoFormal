        "informal problem": "The provided text does not contain a mathematical problem expressed in Isabelle's formal language. Instead, it explains that the Isabelle proof assistant cannot directly handle problems involving illustrations or spatial/geometrical concepts. Such problems need to be expressed in a suitable mathematical formalism before they can be proven using Isabelle."
