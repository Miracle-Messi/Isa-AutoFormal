The final Answer is 22\n ### Proof\n Let $abc$ represent the three-digit number in base 3, where $a$, $b$ and $c$ each represent a digit 0, 1 or 2. The place values in base 3 are 9, 3 and 1, so the base-ten value of $abc$ is $a \\times 9 + b \\times 3 + c \\times 1$, which can be written as $9a + 3b + c$.\n This same value is $cba$ in base 4, which we can  write as $16c + 4b + a$. Equating these two expressions, we get $9a + 3b + c = 16c + 4b + a$.\n We can simplify this to $8a = 15c + b$.\n Now, there are only three digits to try for each letter. It turns out that $8 \\times 2 = 15 \\times 1 + 1$, so the base-three number is $211_3$ and the base-four number is $112_4$. The  base-ten value is $(2 \\times 9) + (1 \\times 3) + 1 = 18 + 3 + 1 = 22$.\n To confirm this answer, we check the base-four value: $1 \\times 16 + 1 \\times 4 + 2 \\times 1 = 16 + 4 + 2 = \\boxed{22}.$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes x :: nat and base3 base4 :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> nat\"\nassumes h0 : \"x = base3 (3 * 3) + base3 3 + base3 1\"\nand h1 : \"x = base4 (4 * 4) + base4 4 + base4 1\"\nand h2 : \"base3 1 = base4 1\"\nand h3 : \"base3 3 = base4 4\"\nand h4 : \"base3 (3 * 3) = base4 (4 * 4)\"\nshows  \"x = 22\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
