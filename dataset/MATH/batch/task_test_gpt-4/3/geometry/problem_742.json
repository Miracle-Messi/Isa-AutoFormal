        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n Dakota randomly selected three different integers $1$ through $6.$ What is the probability that the three numbers selected could be the sides of a triangle? Express your answer as a common fraction. The final Answer is \\frac{7}{20}\n ### Proof\n There are $\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4}{3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = 20$ possible sets of three different integers.\n We need to figure out how many of these could be the sides of a triangle. Clearly, none of the sides can be $1,$ since that would violate the Triangle Inequality. As for the rest, it is quite a simple matter to just list them all in an organized fashion: \\begin{align}\n &(2, 3, 4)\\\\ &(2, 4, 5)\\\\ &(2, 5, 6)\\\\ &(3, 4, 5)\\\\ &(3, 4, 6)\\\\ &(3, 5, 6)\\\\ &(4, 5, 6) \\end{align} Therefore, there are $7$ possible sets of numbers that could be sides of a triangle, out of $20$ possible sets, so our answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{20}}.$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes p :: real\nassumes h0 : \"p = (card { (a,b,c). a \\<in> {1..6} \\<and> b \\<in> {1..6} \\<and> c \\<in> {1..6} \\<and> a \\<noteq> b \\<and> a \\<noteq> c \\<and> b \\<noteq> c \\<and> a + b > c \\<and> a + c > b \\<and> b + c > a } / card { (a,b,c). a \\<in> {1..6} \\<and> b \\<in> {1..6} \\<and> c \\<in> {1..6} \\<and> a \\<noteq> b \\<and> a \\<noteq> c \\<and> b \\<noteq> c })\"\nshows  \"p = 7 / 20\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
