Plugging this value of $b$ into the first given equation to solve for $a$, we find that $a=12$. Plugging this value of $a$ into the fourth given equation to solve for $c$, we find that $c=10$.\n Finally, plugging $c$ into the third equation gives $d=18$.\n Thus, the entire trail was $a+b+c+d=12+14+10+18=\\boxed{54}$ miles long. Of course, you could also have realized that the total for the first two days was 26 miles and the total for the last two days was 28 miles, meaning that the total for all four days is $26 + 28 = \\boxed{54}$ miles.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes day1 day2 day3 day4 :: real\nassumes h0 : \"day1 + day2 = 26\"\nand h1 : \"(day2 + day3) / 2 = 12\"\nand h2 : \"day3 + day4 = 28\"\nand h3 : \"day1 + day3 = 22\"\nshows  \"day1 + day2 + day3 + day4 = 54\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "Four consecutive days have the following properties: the sum of the first two days is 26, the average of the second and third days is 12, the sum of the third and fourth days is 28, and the sum of the first and third days is 22. Find the sum of all four days. The final answer is 54."
