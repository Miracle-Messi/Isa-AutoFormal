        "informal problem": "Given that AB = 6, BC = 8 in a triangle ABC and M and N are the midpoints of AB and BC respectively. If P is the intersection of the line through M and N and the line AC, show that the area of the triangle APC is 8. The area of a triangle is given by 0.5 times the product of the distances of P from A and C."
