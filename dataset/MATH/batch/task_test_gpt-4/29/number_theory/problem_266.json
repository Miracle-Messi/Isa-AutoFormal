The final Answer is 59\n ### Proof\n Let $AB$ be a two-digit integer with the property that $AB$ is equal to the sum of its first digit plus its second digit plus the product of its two digits.\n Thus we have $10A+B=A+B+AB\\Leftrightarrow9A=AB$.\n Now since $AB$ is a two-digit integer, $A\\ne0$, so we can divide both sides by $A$ to get $9=B$.\n Therefore, 19, 29, 39, 49, 59, 69, 79, 89, and 99 all have the property. Their arithmetic mean is $\\frac{\\frac{9(19+99)}{2}}{9}=\\frac{19+99}{2}=\\boxed{59}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes f :: \"(nat \\<times> nat) \\<Rightarrow> nat\"\nassumes h0 : \"\\<forall>x y. x \\<in> {1..9} \\<and> y \\<in> {0..9} \\<longrightarrow> f(x, y) = x + y + x*y\"\nand h1 : \"\\<forall>x y. x \\<in> {1..9} \\<and> y \\<in> {0..9} \\<longrightarrow> f(x, y) = 10*x + y\"\nshows  \"sum f {x | x. fst x \\<in> {1..9} \\<and> snd x \\<in> {0..9}} / card {x | x. fst x \\<in> {1..9} \\<and> snd x \\<in> {0..9}} = 59\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
