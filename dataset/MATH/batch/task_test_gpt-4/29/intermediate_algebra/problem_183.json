Find the set of all possible values of\n\\[\\frac{c}{a} + \\frac{a}{b + c} + \\frac{b}{c}.\\] The final Answer is (2,\\infty)\n ### Proof\n Let \\[S = \\frac{c}{a} + \\frac{a}{b + c} + \\frac{b}{c}.\\]Then \\[S + 1 = \\frac{c}{a} + \\frac{a}{b + c} + \\frac{b}{c} + 1 = \\frac{c}{a} + \\frac{a}{b + c} + \\frac{b + c}{c}.\\]By AM-GM, \\begin{align} S + 1 &= \\frac{c}{a} + \\frac{a}{b + c} + \\frac{b + c}{c} \\\\\n &\\ge 3 \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{c}{a} \\cdot \\frac{a}{b + c} \\cdot \\frac{b + c}{c}} \\\\ &= 3. \\end{align}Note that equality occurs if and only if \\[\\frac{c}{a} = \\frac{a}{b + c} = \\frac{b + c}{c} = 1.\\]Since $b$ and $c$ are positive, \\[\\frac{b + c}{c} > 1,\\]which tells us that equality cannot occur.\n Therefore, $S + 1 > 3,$ which means $S > 2.$\n We claim that $S$ can take on all real numbers that are greater than 2.\n Let $c = a,$ so \\[S = 1 + \\frac{a}{b + a} + \\frac{b}{a}.\\]As $b$ approaches 0, this expression approaches 2. This tells us that we can make this expression arbitrarily close to 2 as we want. On the other hand, as $b$ becomes very large, the expression also becomes very large.\n This tells us that can we can make this expression arbitrarily large.\n Hence, by a continuity argument, $S$ can take on all values in $\\boxed{(2,\\infty)}.$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes a b c :: real\nassumes h0 : \"a > 0\"\nand h1 : \"b > 0\"\nand h2 : \"c > 0\"\nshows  \"c / a + a / (b + c) + b / c > 2\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
