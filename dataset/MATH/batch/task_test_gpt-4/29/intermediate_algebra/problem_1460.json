Then the next term is $2(x - 1) = 2x - 2,$ and the next term after that is $2x - 2 + 1 = 2x - 1.$ This confirms that in the sequence 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, $\\dots,$ each term is double the previous term.\n Then the 50th term in this geometric sequence is $3 \\cdot 2^{49},$ so the 100th term in the original sequence is $3 \\cdot 2^{49} - 1,$ so $k = \\boxed{49}.$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes f :: \"int \\<Rightarrow> int\"\nassumes h0 : \"f 1 = 1\"\nand h1 : \"\\<forall> n. n \\<ge> 1 \\<longrightarrow> f (2*n) = 2 * f (2*n - 1)\"\nand h2 : \"\\<forall> n. n \\<ge> 1 \\<longrightarrow> f (2*n + 1) = f (2*n) + 1\"\nshows  \"\\<exists> k. f 100 = 3 * (2 powr k) - 1 \\<and> k = 49\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
