When reading from left to right, the letters must be in alphabetical order and the digits must be in increasing order. How many different license plate combinations are possible? The final Answer is 10800\n ### Proof\n Given any set of two distinct letters (neither of which is O) and two distinct digits (neither of which is 0), we can build exactly one license plate because, whatever the letters and digits, there is only one allowed order.\n We can choose two distinct letters (excluding O) in $\\binom{25}{2}$ ways and two distinct digits (excluding 0) in $\\binom{9}{2}$ ways.\n Thus the total number of license plates is $\\binom{25}{2}\\binom{9}{2} = \\boxed{10800}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes license_plate :: \"string\"\nassumes h0 : \"length license_plate = 4\"\nand h1 : \"\\<forall>i j. i < j \\<and> i < 2 \\<and> j < 2 \\<longrightarrow> nth license_plate i < nth license_plate j\"\nand h2 : \"\\<forall>i j. i < j \\<and> i \\<ge> 2 \\<and> j \\<ge> 2 \\<longrightarrow> nth license_plate i < nth license_plate j\"\nand h3 : \"distinct (take 2 license_plate)\"\nand h4 : \"distinct (drop 2 license_plate)\"\nand h5 : \"\\<forall>i. i < 2 \\<longrightarrow> nth license_plate i \\<in> set (['A'..<char_of(79)] @ [char_of(80)]<..<'Z')\"\nand h6 : \"\\<forall>i. i \\<ge> 2 \\<longrightarrow> nth license_plate i \\<in> set (['1'..'9'] - ['0'])\"\nshows  \"card {license_plate. \\<forall>i j.
