For the compounded interest, we use the formula $A=P\\left(1+\\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}$, where $A$ is the end balance, $P$ is the principal, $r$ is the interest rate, $t$ is the number of years, and $n$ is the number of times compounded in a year.\n This equation represents the idea that the interest is compounded every $1/n$ years with a rate of $r/n$ each time.\n Substituting the information given, we get $$A=20000\\left(1+\\frac{0.07}{4}\\right)^{4 \\cdot 4}=20000\\left(1+\\frac{0.07}{4}\\right)^{16} \\approx 26399.$$Therefore, she should choose the compounded interest and earn $26399-24800=\\boxed{1599 \\text{ dollars}}$ more.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes principal :: real and t :: real and simple_interest_rate compound_interest_rate :: real\nand n :: nat\nassumes h0 : \"principal = 20000\"\nand h1 : \"t = 4\"\nand h2 : \"simple_interest_rate = 0.06\"\nand h3 : \"compound_interest_rate = 0.07\"\nand h4 : \"n = 4\"\nshows  \"round ((principal * (1 + compound_interest_rate / n) powr (n * t)) - (principal * (1 + simple_interest_rate * t))) = 1599\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",

One account earns a simple interest rate of 6% per year, and the other account earns a compound interest rate of 7% per year compounded quarterly. After 4 years, how much more money will the compounded account have earned compared to the simple interest account? Round your answer to the nearest dollar. The final answer is $1,599."
