        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n If $a$ and $b$ are positive integers such that $\\gcd(a,b)=210$, $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]=210^3$, and $a<b$, how many possible values are there for $a$? The final Answer is 8\n ### Proof\n Note that the prime factorization of $210$ is $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 5\\cdot 7$, and so the prime factorization of $210^3$ is $2^3\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^3\\cdot 7^3$. Given that $\\gcd(a,b)=210$ and $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]=210^3$, we must have $a=2^k\\cdot 3^\\ell\\cdot 5^m\\cdot 7^n$ and $b=2^p\\cdot 3^q\\cdot 5^r\\cdot 7^s$ where each of the ordered pairs $(k,p),(\\ell,q),(m,r),(n,s)$ is either $(1,3)$ or $(3,1)$.\n Therefore, if we ignore the condition $a<b$, there are independently two choices for each of $k$, $\\ell$, $m$, and $n$, and these choices determine both of the numbers $a$ and $b$.\n We have $2\\cdot 2\\cdot 2\\cdot 2=16$ ways to make all four choices.\n However, these $16$ sets of choices will generate each possible pair of values for $a$ and $b$ in both possible orders. Half of these choices will satisfy $a<b$ and half will satisfy $a>b$.\n So, imposing the condition $a<b$, we see that there are $\\frac{16}{2}=\\boxed{8}$ possible choices for $a$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes a b :: int\nassumes h0 : \"a > 0\"\nand h1 : \"b > 0\"\nand h2 : \"gcd a b = 210\"\nand h3 : \"lcm a b = 210^3\"\nand h4 : \"a < b\"\nshows  \"card {a. \\<exists> b. a > 0 \\<and> b > 0 \\<and> gcd a b = 210 \\<and> lcm a b = 210^3 \\<and> a < b} = 8\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
