        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n The equations $x^3 + 5x^2 + px + q = 0$ and $x^3 + 7x^2 + px + r = 0$ have two roots in common.  If the third root of each equation is represented by $x_1$ and $x_2$ respectively, compute the ordered pair $(x_1,x_2).$ The final Answer is (-5,-7)\n ### Proof\n If $a$ is a root of both polynomials, then $a$ is also a root of the difference of the polynomials, which is \\[(x^3 + 7x^2 + px + r) - (x^3 + 5x^2 + px + q) = 2x^2 + (r - q) = 0.\\]And if $a$ is a root of this polynomial, so is $-a,$ and their sum is 0.\n By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of $x^3 + 5x^2 + px + q = 0$ is $-5,$ so the third root is $-5.$  Similarly, the third root of $x^3 + 7x^2 + px + r = 0$ is $-7,$ so $(x_1,x_2) = \\boxed{(-5,-7)}.$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes x x1 x2 :: real and P Q :: \"real \\<Rightarrow> real\"\nassumes h0 : \"\\<forall> x.

        "informal problem": "Consider two cubic equations, $P(x) = x^3 + 5x^2 + px + q$ and $Q(x) = x^3 + 7x^2 + px + r$. These equations each have two distinct roots in common. Also, for each equation, any solution is either a specific number or a solution to the other equation. The specific number for $P(x)$ is $x1$ and for $Q(x)$ is $x2$. Given these conditions, find the values of $x1$ and $x2$. The final answers are $x1 = -5$ and $x2 = -7$."
