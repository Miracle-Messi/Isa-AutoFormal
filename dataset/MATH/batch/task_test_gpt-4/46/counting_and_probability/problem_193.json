Given that a dart is thrown that hits the target at a random point, what is the probability that it hits a shaded region? Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\n[asy]size(100); import graph; fill(Circle((0,0),5),gray(.6));\n\nclip(Circle((0,0),2) ^^ Circle((0,0),3) ^^ Circle((0,0),4),fillrule(1));\ndraw(Circle((0,0),2) ^^ Circle((0,0),3) ^^ Circle((0,0),4) ^^ Circle((0,0),5));[/asy] The final Answer is \\frac{11}{25}\n ### Proof\n The total area of the target is $\\pi\\cdot 10^2=100\\pi$. The area of the inner shaded region is the area of a circle with radius 4, and that is equal to $\\pi\\cdot 4^2=16\\pi$.\n We can calculate the area of the shaded ring as the difference in areas of a circle with radius 8 and with radius 6. This gives an area of $\\pi \\cdot 8^2 - \\pi \\cdot 6^2 = 28\\pi$. The total shaded area is $16\\pi+28\\pi=44\\pi$.\n The probability a dart will hit a shaded region is equal to $\\frac{44\\pi}{100\\pi}=\\boxed{\\frac{11}{25}}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes radii :: \"real list\"\nand shaded_area total_area :: real\nassumes h0 : \"radii = [4, 6, 8, 10]\"\nand h1 : \"shaded_area = (\\<Sum>r\\<leftarrow>radii.

        "informal problem": "There are four concentric circles with radii 4, 6, 8, and 10. The shaded area is the area of the even-numbered circles minus the area of the circles with radii 2 units smaller than them (e.g., the shaded area of the circle with radius 6 is the area of the circle with radius 6 minus the area of the circle with radius 4). What is the ratio of the total shaded area to the area of the largest circle? The final answer is $\\frac{11}{25}$."
