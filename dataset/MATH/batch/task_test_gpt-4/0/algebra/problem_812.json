A market survey shows that each decrease of $\\$5$ on the price will result in the sale of an additional 10 smartphones per week. What price of the smartphone would result in maximum revenue, in dollars? The final Answer is 350\n ### Proof\n Suppose the price of the cellphone is reduced to $450 - 5x$ dollars; then it will sell $500 + 10x$ units, so the revenue will be \\begin{align} (450 - 5x)(500 + 10x) &= 5(90 - x) 10(50 + x) \\\\ &= 50 (90 - x)(50 + x) \\\\\n &= 50 (-x^2  + 40x + 4500), \\end{align}in dollars. Completing the square on $-x^2 + 40x + 4500,$ we get \\begin{align} 50 (-x^2 + 40x + 4500) &= 50 (-(x - 20)^2 + 400 + 4500) \\\\ &= 50 (-(x - 20)^2 + 4900) \\\\\n &= -50 (x - 20)^2 + 245000. \\end{align}This is maximized when $x = 20,$ so the optimal price of the smartphone is $450 - 5(20) = \\boxed{350}$ dollars.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes price :: real\nand revenue smartphones :: \"real \\<Rightarrow> real\"\nassumes h0 : \"smartphones price = 500 + 10 * ((450 - price) / 5)\"\nand h1 : \"revenue price = price * smartphones price\"\nshows  \"MAXIMUM revenue price = 350\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "A company sells smartphones at a certain price. The number of smartphones sold can be modeled by the function $s(p) = 500 + 10 \\cdot \\frac{450 - p}{5}$, where $p$ is the price of a smartphone. The revenue generated by selling smartphones can be modeled by the function $r(p) = p \\cdot s(p)$. Find the maximum revenue that can be achieved by the company. The final answer is $350$.",
