        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n Suppose we are given seven points that are equally spaced around a circle.  If $P$, $Q$, and $R$ are chosen to be any three of these points, then how many different possible values are there for $m\\angle PQR$? The final Answer is $5$\n ### Proof\n The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that $m\\angle PQR$ is half the measure of arc $PR$.\nSo the measure of angle $\\angle PQR$ depends only on the size of arc $PR$. The seven given points are equally spaced around the circle, so they divide the circumference into seven congruent arcs. Arc $PR$ could consist of one, two, three, four, or five of these pieces.\n(Draw a few quick pictures if this is not immediately apparent; in particular, convince yourself that enclosing six pieces is not an option.)\nTherefore there are only $\\boxed{5}$ different values for $m\\angle PQR$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes P Q R :: \"real \\<Rightarrow> real\"\nassumes h0 : \"\\<forall> x.

        "informal problem": " Consider three functions P, Q, and R, each mapping real numbers to real numbers. For any real number x, the values of P(x), Q(x), and R(x) are always in the set {0, 2\u03c0/7, 4\u03c0/7, 6\u03c0/7, 8\u03c0/7, 10\u03c0/7, 12\u03c0/7}. The measure of the angle PQR(x) is defined as the absolute difference between Q(x) and P(x). We want to find the number of distinct x values for which there exist P, Q, and R such that the measure of the angle PQR(x) equals x. The answer is 5.",
