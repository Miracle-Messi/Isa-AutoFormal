        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n A regular tetrahedron is a triangular pyramid in which each face is an equilateral triangle.  If the height of a regular tetrahedron is 20 inches then what is the length of each edge of the tetrahedron? Express your answer in simplest radical form. The final Answer is $10\\sqrt{6}$\n ### Proof\n Recall that a median of a triangle is a line segment drawn from a vertex of the triangle to the midpoint of the opposite side. The three medians of a triangle intersect in a common point called the centroid of the triangle.\nThe centroid divides each median into two segments whose lengths have ratio 2:1. Call the four vertices of the tetrahedron $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$. Also, define $E$ to be the midpoint of $AB$ and $M$ to be the centroid of triangle $ABC$.\nLet $s$ be the side length of the tetrahedron.\nFrom the Pythagorean theorem applied to right triangle $AEC$, we find that $CE=\\sqrt{s^2-(s/2)^2}=s\\sqrt{3}/2$. Since $M$ is the centroid of triangle $ABC$, $AM=\\frac{2}{3}(CE)=\\frac{2}{3}\\left(\\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)=\\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{3}$.\nFinally, applying the Pythagorean theorem to $AMD$, we find $\\left(\\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\right)^2+DM^2=s^2$.\nSubstituting $20$ inches for $DM$, we solve to find $s=\\boxed{10\\sqrt{6}}$ inches.
