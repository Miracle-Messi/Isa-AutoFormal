        "informal problem": "In a stamp collecting competition, four countries - Brazil, France, Peru, and Spain - participated. Brazil and France each collected 6 stamps, Peru collected 4, and Spain collected 5. It is known that the sum of the number of stamps collected by Brazil or Peru and France or Spain is 11. Similarly, the sum of the number of stamps collected by France or Spain and Brazil or Peru is 11. Each country collected stamps from a set of 50, 60, 70, or 80 stamps, and a predicate $P(x,y)$ is defined to be true if country $x$ collected stamps from set $y$. It is known that for any $x$ and $y$, $P(x,y)$ implies $x$ is one of Brazil, France, Peru, or Spain, and $y$ is one of 50, 60, 70, or 80. It is also known that the number of stamps collected from the 80s set by any country is equal to the sum of the number of stamps collected by France and Spain from that set. The number of stamps collected by France and Spain from the 80s set is given by a function $P(x,y)$ defined for each country $x$ and set $y$. Specifically, $P(x,y)$ is the number of stamps collected by country $x$ from set $y$ multiplied by a fixed value that depends on $y$. Finally, it is known that the number of stamps collected from the 80s set by all four countries combined is 24. Find the number of stamps collected from the 80s set by France and Spain combined.

The price of Brazilian stamps is 6.\n2. The price of French stamps is 6.\n3. The price of Spanish stamps is 4.\n4. The price of German stamps is 5.\n\nWe are also given a formula to calculate the total number of European stamps:\n\neuropean_stamps = (brazil_price + france_price + spain_price) * 8\n\nUsing the given prices, we can calculate the total number of European stamps.
