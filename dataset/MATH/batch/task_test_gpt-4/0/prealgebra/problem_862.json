Testing $n = 7$, we see by dividing that 67 is not divisible by 7. Testing $n = 8$, we see by dividing that 68 is not divisible by 8.\n Testing $n = 9$, we see using the divisibility rule for 9 that 69 is not divisible by 9 (since the sum of its digits is $6+9=15$ is not divisible by 9).\n Thus, the answer is 1,2,3,4,5,6, which is $\\boxed{6}$ digits.\n *)\n\ndatatype Digit = D0 | D1 | D2 | D3 | D4 | D5 | D6 | D7 | D8 | D9\n\nfun toInt :: \"Digit \\<Rightarrow> int\" where\n\"toInt D0 = 0\" |\n\"toInt D1 = 1\" |\n\"toInt D2 = 2\" |\n\"toInt D3 = 3\" |\n\"toInt D4 = 4\" |\n\"toInt D5 = 5\" |\n\"toInt D6 = 6\" |\n\"toInt D7 = 7\" |\n\"toInt D8 = 8\" |\n\"toInt D9 = 9\"\n\ndefinition isDivisible :: \"int \\<Rightarrow> Digit \\<Rightarrow> bool\" where\n\"isDivisible i d = (i mod (toInt d) = 0)\"\n\ntheorem\nshows  \"card {d. isDivisible 60 d} = 6\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
