        "The three lights blink simultaneously $t$ seconds after the start of the dance if and only if $t$ is a common multiple of 2, 3, and 5. Recall the common multiples of a set of integers are precisely the multiples of the least common multiple.",
        "Since 2, 3, and 5 are relatively prime, their least common multiple is $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 5 = 30$.",
        "Thus the light blinks $t$ seconds after the beginning of the song for $t=0,1,2,\\ldots,14$, and after 14 thirty-second periods, the song ends.",
        "Thus the lights blink in unison a total of $\\boxed{15}$ times."
