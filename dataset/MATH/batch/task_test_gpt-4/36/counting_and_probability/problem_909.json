        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n There are 190 people on the beach.  110 are wearing sunglasses, 70 are wearing bathing suits, and 95 are wearing a hat.  Everyone is wearing at least one of these items. 30 are wearing both bathing suits and sunglasses. 25 are wearing both bathing suits and a hat. 40 are wearing both sunglasses and a hat.  How many people are wearing all three items? The final Answer is 10\n ### Proof\n Let $x$ be number of people wearing all three items. Since 30 people are wearing bathing suits and sunglasses, we know that $30 - x$ are wearing just bathing suits and sunglasses.\n Similarly, $25 - x$ are wearing just bathing suits and hats, while $40 - x$ are wearing just sunglasses and a hat.\n To find the number of people wearing just sunglasses, we subtract the people who are wearing sunglasses with other items from the total number of people wearing sunglasses, which is $110 - (30 - x) - (40 - x) - x = 40 + x$.\n Similarly, the number of people wearing just hats is $30 + x$, while the number of people wearing just bathing suits is $15 + x$. Since the total number of people on the beach is 190, and everyone is wearing one of the items, we have: \\begin{align}\n 190 &= (15 + x) + (40 + x) + (30 + x) \\\\ &\\qquad+ (25 - x ) + (30 - x) + (40 - x) + x\\\\ &= 180 + x. \\end{align} We can then solve for $x$, so the number of people on the beach wearing all three items is $x = \\boxed{10}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes total_people sunglasses bathingsuits hats ss_and_bs bs_and_hats ss_and_hats all_three :: nat\nassumes h0 : \"total_people = 190\"\nand h1 : \"sunglasses = 110\"\nand h2 : \"bathingsuits = 70\"\nand h3 : \"hats = 95\"\nand h4 : \"ss_and_bs = 30\"\nand h5 : \"bs_and_hats = 25\"\nand h6 : \"ss_and_hats = 40\"\nand h7 : \"total_people = sunglasses + bathingsuits + hats - ss_and_bs - bs_and_hats - ss_and_hats + all_three\"\nshows  \"all_three = 10\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
