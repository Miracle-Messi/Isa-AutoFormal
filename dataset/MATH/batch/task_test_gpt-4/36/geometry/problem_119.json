        "informal problem": "It seems there's been a misunderstanding as there is no Isabelle statement given to translate. However, the paragraph explains that Isabelle, a proof assistant used in formalizing mathematical proofs, is not suitable for dealing with specific geometric problems that involve diagrams. Instead, it is more suitable for abstract mathematical reasoning. For specific geometric computations, it is recommended to use a computational geometry tool or a computer algebra system."
