        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n The solid shown was formed by cutting a right circular cylinder in half. If the base has a radius of 6 cm and the height is 10 cm, what is the total surface area, in terms of $\\pi$, of the solid? [asy]\nimport three;\nsize(100);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.7pt));\ncurrentprojection=orthographic(4,2.5,3);\n\npath3 p=arc((0,0,0),(1,0,0),(-1,0,0),(0,0,1));\n\ndraw(rotate(45,(0,0,1))*p,dashed);\ndraw(rotate(45,(0,0,1))*((1,0,0)--(-1,0,0)--(-1,0,2)--(1,0,2)--cycle));\ndraw(rotate(45,(0,0,1))*shift((0,0,2))*p);\ndraw(rotate(118,(0,0,1))*((1,0,0)--(1,0,2)));\n[/asy] The final Answer is 96\\pi+120\n ### Proof\n The surface area of the solid can be split into four pieces:  the top and bottom, the curved side, and the flat side. The top and bottom pieces are semicircles with radius 6; together, they add up to a circle with radius 6 and area $\\pi(6^2)=36\\pi$.\n The curved side can be rolled out to a rectangle with height 10. The width of this rectangle is half the circumference of the base of the cylinder, which is $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 2\\pi\\cdot 6 = 6\\pi$.\n Thus the area of the curved side is $10\\cdot 6\\pi = 60\\pi$. The flat side is a rectangle with height 10. The width of this rectangle is the diameter of the cylinder, which is $6\\cdot 2 = 12$.\n Thus the area of the flat side is $10\\cdot 12 = 120$. Finally, the total surface area of the solid is $36\\pi+60\\pi+120=\\boxed{96\\pi+120}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes r h :: real\nassumes h0 : \"r = 6\"\nand h1 : \"h = 10\"\nshows  \"2 * pi * r * h + 2 * pi * r powr 2 = 96 * pi + 120\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
