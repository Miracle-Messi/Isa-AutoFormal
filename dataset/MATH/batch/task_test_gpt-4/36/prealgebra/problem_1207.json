        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n Find the sum of the primes between 100 and 200, inclusive, that are 1 or 2 more than a perfect square. The final Answer is 298\n ### Proof\n The perfect squares from 100 and 200 (inclusive) are 100, 121, 144, 169, and 196. The numbers that are 1 or 2 larger than those perfect squares are as follows: 101, 102, 122, 123, 145, 146, 170, 171, 197, and 198.\n Clearly, no even number greater than 2 can be a prime number, so we narrow our field down to 101, 123, 145, 171, and 197. Testing, we see that 101 is prime, 123 is not (3 times 41), 145 is not (5 times 29), 171 is not (9 times 19), and 197 is prime.\n Hence, the sum of the primes that fit the problem is $101+197= \\boxed{298}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes sum_primes_between :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> nat \\<Rightarrow> nat\"\nand is_prime :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> bool\"\nand perfect_square :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> bool\"\nassumes h0 : \"\\<forall> x y. perfect_square x \\<longrightarrow> (x + 1 \\<le> y \\<and> y \\<le> x + 2) \\<longrightarrow> is_prime y\"\nand h1 : \"sum_primes_between 100 200 = sum (\\<lambda> i. if is_prime i \\<and> (\\<exists> x. perfect_square x \\<and> (x + 1 \\<le> i \\<and> i \\<le> x + 2)) then i else 0) {100..200}\"\nshows  \"sum_primes_between 100 200 = 298\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
