        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n A math club is having a bake sale as a fundraiser to raise money for an upcoming trip. They sell $54$ cookies at three for $\\$1$, and $20$ cupcakes at $\\$2$ each, and $35$ brownies at $\\$1$ each. If it cost the math club $\\$15$ to bake these items, what was their profit? The final Answer is 78\n ### Proof\n To find the profit, we want to find out how much the math club earned from selling the various baked goods and subtract the cost of producing those goods, $\\$15$, from the number we get. First let's calculate how much the math club earned from selling cookies.\n The cookies were sold at a price of three for $\\$1$, so the math club earned $54\\div 3\\cdot\\$1=18\\cdot\\$1=\\$18$ from selling cookies. Next, let's calculate how much the club earned from selling cupcakes.\n At a price of $\\$2$ each, the club earned $20\\cdot \\$2=\\$40$ from selling cupcakes. Finally, let's calculate how much the club earned from selling brownies. At a price of $\\$1$ each, the club earned $35\\cdot\\$1=\\$35$ from selling brownies.\n Now let's add up these numbers to find out how much the club earned in total and subtract $\\$15$ from that number to find the club's profit.\n We obtain \\begin{align} \\$18+\\$40+\\$35-\\$15&=\\$18+\\$40+\\$35-\\$15\\\\ &=\\$18+\\$40+\\$35+(-\\$15)\\\\ &=\\$18+\\$40+(\\$35+(-\\$15))\\\\ &=\\$18+\\$40+(\\$20)\\\\ &=\\boxed{78}. \\end{align}Notice how we used the definition of subtraction, $a-b=a+(-b)$ to $\\$35-\\$15$ as $\\$35+(-\\$15)$ and the associative property of addition to group the numbers together.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes cookies cupcakes brownies cost profit :: real\nassumes h0 : \"cookies = 54 / 3\"\nand h1 : \"cupcakes = 20 * 2\"\nand h2 : \"brownies = 35 * 1\"\nand h3 : \"cost = 15\"\nand h4 : \"profit = (cookies + cupcakes + brownies - cost)\"\nshows  \"profit = 78\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
