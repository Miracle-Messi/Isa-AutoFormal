        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n Let $(x,y)$ be an ordered pair of real numbers that satisfies the equation $x^2+y^2=14x+48y$. What is the minimum value of $x$? The final Answer is -18\n ### Proof\n Moving all the terms to the LHS, we have the equation $x^2-14x+y^2-48y=0$. Completing the square on the quadratic in $x$, we add $(14/2)^2=49$ to both sides. Completing the square on the quadratic in $y$, we add $(48/2)^2=576$ to both sides.\n We have the equation  \\[(x^2-14x+49)+(y^2-48y+576)=625 \\Rightarrow (x-7)^2+(y-24)^2=625\\]Rearranging, we have $(x-7)^2=625-(y-24)^2$. Taking the square root and solving for $x$, we get $x=\\pm \\sqrt{625-(y-24)^2}+7$.\n Since $\\sqrt{625-(y-24)^2}$ is always nonnegative, the minimum value of $x$ is achieved when we use a negative sign in front of the square root.\n Now, we want the largest possible value of the square root. In other words, we want to maximize $625-(y-24)^2$. Since $(y-24)^2$ is always nonnegative, $625-(y-24)^2$ is maximized when $(y-24)^2=0$ or when $y=24$.\n At this point, $625-(y-24)^2=625$ and $x=-\\sqrt{625}+7=-18$.\n Thus, the minimum $x$ value is $\\boxed{-18}$. --OR-- Similar to the solution above, we can complete the square to get the equation $(x-7)^2+(y-24)^2=625$. This equation describes a circle with center at $(7,24)$ and radius $\\sqrt{625}=25$.\n The minimum value of $x$ is achieved at the point on the left side of the circle, which is located at $(7-25,24)=(-18,24)$.\n Thus, the minimum value of $x$ is $\\boxed{-18}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes x y :: real\nassumes h0 : \"x powr 2 + y powr 2 = 14 * x + 48 * y\"\nshows  \"LEAST x. \\<exists>y. x powr 2 + y powr 2 = 14 * x + 48 * y = -18\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
