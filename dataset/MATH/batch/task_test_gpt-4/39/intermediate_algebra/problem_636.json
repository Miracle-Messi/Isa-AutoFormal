        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n Find the remainder when the polynomial $x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x$ is divided by $x^3-4x$. The final Answer is 5x^2+21x\n ### Proof\n Let $P(x) = x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x$ and let $Q(x)$ be the quotient when $P(x)$ is divided by $x^3-4x$. Since we are dividing by a cubic, our remainder has degree at most $2$, meaning it is of the form $ax^2+bx+c$ for some constants $a$, $b$, and $c$.\n So we have $$P(x) = (x^3-4x)Q(x) + ax^2+bx+c.$$Since $x^3-4x = x(x^2-4) = x(x+2)(x-2)$, we can let $x = 0 \\, , 2$, or $-2$ to make $x^3-4x =0$. Doing each of them gives us the equations: $$ \\begin{aligned}\n 0 &= P(0) = c, \\\\ 62 &= P(2) = 4a+2b+c, \\\\ -22 &= P(-2) = 4a-2b+c. \\end{aligned}$$Since $P(0) = 0$, we know $c=0$.
