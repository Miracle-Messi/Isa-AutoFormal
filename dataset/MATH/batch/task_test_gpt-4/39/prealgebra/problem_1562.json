Every week, each person hugs the people immediately to his or her left and right. How many weeks does it take (at a minimum) for every pair of people to hug at least once? The final Answer is 4\n ### Proof\n There are $8$ people, each of whom has $7$ others to hug, making $8\\cdot 7$ pairs.\n However, this counts each pair twice (once for each ordering of the two people). Since order doesn't matter, the actual number of hugs that must take place is $(8\\cdot 7)/2,$ which is $28.$ Every week, $7$ different hugs take place, since there are $7$ positions where two people are side-by-side.\n So, we know it will take at least $28/7 = \\boxed{4}$ weeks for every pair to hug at least once. Here's one possible way they can sit so that every pair is side-by-side once: $$\\begin{array}{r l} \\text{Week 1:} & \\text{A B C D E F G H} \\\\\n &\\\\ \\text{Week 2:} & \\text{B D F H A C E G} \\\\ &\\\\ \\text{Week 3:} & \\text{C H E B G D A F} \\\\ &\\\\ \\text{Week 4:} & \\text{D H B F C G A E} \\end{array}$$\n *)\n\nThis problem is more of a combinatorics problem rather than a mathematical theorem to be proved. It does not translate well to Isabelle, as Isabelle is a theorem prover, not a problem solver. However, a (very) rough translation could be:\n\ndatatype Person = P1 | P2 | P3 | P4 | P5 | P6 | P7 | P8\ntype_synonym Seating = \"Person list\"\n\nfun neighbors :: \"Seating \\<Rightarrow> (Person * Person) set\" where\n\"neighbors [] = {}\" |\n\"neighbors [x] = {}\" |\n\"neighbors (x#y#xs) = {(x, y), (y, x)} \\<union> neighbors (y#xs)\"\n\ndefinition all_pairs :: \"(Person * Person) set\" where\n\"all_pairs = {(x, y) |x y. x \\<noteq> y}\"\n\ntheorem\nfixes seatings :: \"Seating list\"\nassumes h0 : \"length seatings = 4\"\nand h1 : \"distinct (concat seatings)\"\nand h2 : \"\\<Union>(set (map neighbors seatings)) = all_pairs\"\nshows  \"every pair of people to hug at least once in 4 weeks\"\n\nNote that this Isabelle code will not compile, because it is not possible to exhaustively list all possible seatings of people in a church pew in Isabelle. Also, the theorem statement is not well-defined in Isabelle. This just gives a flavor of how one might attempt to represent this problem in Isabelle, but it is not a complete translation.\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",

After four weeks, every pair of people have sat next to each other at least once. Translate this scenario into a theorem. \n\nPlease note that the Isabelle version isn't a perfect representation of the problem. It attempts to create a list of all possible seating arrangements, which isn't feasible in Isabelle. Also, the formulation of the theorem isn't well-defined."
