        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n The product of two positive integers is $144$. The ratio of their least common multiple to their greatest common divisor is equal to $9$. What is the sum of the two integers? The final Answer is 40\n ### Proof\n Let the integers be $a$ and $b$. Then $ab = 144$ and $$\\frac{\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]}{\\gcd(a,b)} = 9.$$The identity $ab = \\gcd(a,b) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]$ yields that $$ab = \\gcd(a,b) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = 144.$$Multiplying the two equations above yields that $\\big(\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]\\big)^2 = 9 \\cdot 144 = 36^2$, so $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = 36$.\n Then $\\gcd(a,b) = 144/36 = 4$. Since $\\gcd(a,b) = 4$ is a divisor of both $a$ and $b$, $a$ must have at least two factors of 2, and $b$ must have at least two factors of 2.\n Therefore, their product $ab$ has at least four factors of 2. But $ab = 144 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2$, which has exactly four factors of 2, so both $a$ and $b$ have exactly two factors of 2. Since $ab = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2$, the only primes that can divide $a$ and $b$ are 2 and 3.\n Let $a = 2^2 \\cdot 3^u$ and let $b = 2^2 \\cdot 3^v$. Then $\\gcd(a,b) = 2^2 \\cdot 3^{\\min\\{u,v\\}}$. But $\\gcd(a,b) = 4 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^0$, so $\\min\\{u,v\\} = 0$, which means that either $u = 0$ or $v = 0$.\n Hence, one of the numbers $a$ and $b$ must be 4, and the other number must be $144/4 = 36$.\n Therefore, the sum of the numbers is $4 + 36 = \\boxed{40}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes a b :: nat\nassumes h0 : \"a * b = 144\"\nand h1 : \"lcm a b / gcd a b = 9\"\nshows  \"a + b = 40\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
