The final Answer is 35\n ### Proof\n Let $\\, 2^{e_1} 3^{e_2} 5^{e_3} \\cdots \\,$ be the prime factorization of $\\, n$. Then the  number of positive divisors of $\\, n \\,$ is $\\, (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1)(e_3 + 1) \\cdots \\; $. In view of the given information, we have \\[\n 28 = (e_1 + 2)(e_2 + 1)P \\]and \\[ 30 = (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 2)P, \\]where $\\, P = (e_3 + 1)(e_4 + 1) \\cdots \\; $.\n Subtracting the first equation from the second, we obtain $\\, 2 = (e_1 - e_2)P, \\,$ so either $\\, e_1 - e_2 = 1 \\,$ and $\\, P = 2, \\,$ or $\\, e_1 - e_2 = 2 \\,$ and $\\, P = 1$. The first case yields $\\, 14 = (e_1\n + 2)e_1 \\,$ and  $\\, (e_1 + 1)^2 = 15$; since $\\, e_1 \\,$ is a nonnegative integer, this is impossible. In the second case, $\\, e_2 = e_1 - 2 \\,$ and $\\, 30 = (e_1 + 1)e_1, \\,$ from which we find $\\, e_1 = 5 \\,$ and $\\, e_2 = 3$.\n Thus $\\, n = 2^5 3^3, \\,$ so $\\, 6n = 2^6 3^4 \\,$ has $\\, (6+1)(4+1) = \\boxed{35} \\,$ positive divisors.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes n :: \"nat\"\nassumes h0 : \"n > 0\"\nand h1 : \"card {d. d dvd 2*n} = 28\"\nand h2 : \"card {d. d dvd 3*n} = 30\"\nshows  \"card {d. d dvd 6*n} = 35\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
