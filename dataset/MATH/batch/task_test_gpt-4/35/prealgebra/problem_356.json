        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n Sarah, James, and Matthew are on a team in a game show. In the game, Sarah always earns 5 points, Matthew always earns -2 points, and James always earns 3 points. To calculate their team's score, they multiply the first person's score by the second person's score, then subtract the third person's score. If they can choose the order in which they play the game, what is the maximum possible score that their team can earn? The final Answer is 17\n ### Proof\n If we let the first, second, and third persons' score equal $a$, $b$, and $c$ respectively, then their team's score is $((a \\cdot b)-c)$.\n We may test all six possible orderings: $a = 5$, $b = -2$, $c = 3 \\rightarrow ((5 \\cdot (-2)) - 3) = -13$ $a = -2$, $b = 5$, $c = 3 \\rightarrow (((-2) \\cdot 5) - 3) = -13$ $a = 5$, $b = 3$, $c = -2 \\rightarrow ((5 \\cdot 3) - (-2)) = 17$\n $a = 3$, $b = 5$, $c = -2 \\rightarrow ((3 \\cdot 5) - (-2)) = 17$ $a = 3$, $b = -2$, $c = 5 \\rightarrow ((3 \\cdot (-2)) - 5) = -11$ $a = -2$, $b = 3$, $c = 5 \\rightarrow (((-2) \\cdot 3) - 5) = -11$\n Thus, our total answer is $\\boxed{17}$ Additionally, we may note that the only way to obtain a positive answer is to multiply the two positive scores together and subtract the negative score. Because multiplication is commutative, the order of $a$ and $b$ does not matter, and we need only compute the single case $(3 \\cdot 5) - (-2) = \\boxed{17}$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes sarah_points james_points matthew_points team_score :: int\nassumes h0 : \"sarah_points = 5\"\nand h1 : \"james_points = 3\"\nand h2 : \"matthew_points = -2\"\nand h3 : \"\\<forall>p1 p2 p3. team_score p1 p2 p3 = p1 * p2 - p3\"\nshows  \"Max {team_score p1 p2 p3 |p1 p2 p3. {p1, p2, p3} = {sarah_points, james_points, matthew_points}} = 17\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",

The team's score is calculated as the product of the points of two players minus the points of the third player. What is the maximum possible team score using the points of these three players? The maximum possible team score is 17 points."
