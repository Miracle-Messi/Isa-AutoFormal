The problem is now to determine how many ways $14$ pieces can be assembled using the $1$, $2$, and $4$-piece boxes.\n If we begin with all $1$-piece boxes, there's one way to do that. There are seven ways to have a mix of $1$ and $2$-piece boxes (one $2$-piece, two $2$-pieces, etc. all the way through seven $2$-pieces).\n Now, each pair of $2$-piece boxes can be replaced by a $4$-piece box. If there is one $4$-piece box, there are six ways to box the remaining ten pieces of chocolate with $1$ and $2$-piece boxes (no $2$-pieces, one $2$-piece, etc.\n all the way through five $2$-pieces). If there are two $4$-piece boxes, there are four ways to box the remaining six pieces of chocolate (zero through three $2$-piece boxes). Finally, if there are three $4$-piece boxes, there are two ways to box the remaining two pieces of chocolate (either no $2$-piece boxes or one $2$-piece box).\n Thus, there are a total of $1 + 7 + 6 + 4 + 2 = \\boxed{20}$ combinations of boxes possible.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes n1 n2 n4 :: nat\nassumes h0 : \"n1 + 2 * n2 + 4 * n4 = 15\"\nshows  \"card {(n1, n2, n4). n1 + 2 * n2 + 4 * n4 = 15} = 20\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
