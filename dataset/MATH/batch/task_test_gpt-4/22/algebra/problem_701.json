The total distance that the ball falls is therefore $$\\frac{405\\left(1-\\left(\\frac23\\right)^4\\right)}{1-\\frac23} = 975.$$Now, we calculate the total distance that the ball rises.\n Initially, the ball rises $405(2/3)$ meters. The next time, it rises $405(2/3)(2/3)$ meters, and so on. This time, our geometric series has a first term of $405(2/3),$ common ratio $2/3,$ and three terms.\n Thus, the ball rises a total of $$\\frac{405\\cdot\\frac23\\left(1-\\left(\\frac23\\right)^3\\right)}{1-\\frac23} = 570.$$Adding together these two values, we find that the ball has traveled a total of $975 + 570 = \\boxed{1545}$ meters.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes height :: real\nand rebound_ratio :: real\nand distance_travelled :: real\nassumes h0 : \"height = 405\"\nand h1 : \"rebound_ratio = 2 / 3\"\nand h2 : \"distance_travelled = height + 3 * (height * rebound_ratio + height * (rebound_ratio^2) + height * (rebound_ratio^3))\"\nshows  \"distance_travelled = 1545\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "A ball is dropped from a height of 405 feet. After each bounce, the ball rebounds to a height that is $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the height from which it fell. What is the total distance the ball travels after it hits the ground for the third time? The final answer is 1545 feet."
