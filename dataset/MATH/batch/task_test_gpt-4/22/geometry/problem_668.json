Also assume that the fraction $m / n$ equals to the sum of the series of the difference of the squares of consecutive numbers from 2 to 100 divided by the square of 100.

        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n One hundred concentric circles with radii $1,2,3,\\ldots,100$ are drawn in a plane. The interior of the circle of radius $1$ is colored red, and each region bounded by consecutive circles is colored either red or green, with no two adjacent regions the same color. The ratio of the total area of the green regions to the area of the circle of radius 100 can be expressed as $m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$. The final Answer is 301\n ### Proof\n The sum of the areas of the green regions is \\begin{align} &\\phantom{=}\\ \\left[(2^2-1^2)+(4^2-3^2)+(6^2-5^2)+\\cdots+(100^2-99^2)\\right]\\pi\\\\ &=\\left[(2+1)+(4+3)+(6+5)+\\cdots+(100+99)\\right]\\pi\\\\ &={1\\over2}\\cdot100\\cdot101\\pi.\n \\end{align}Thus the desired ratio is $${1\\over2}\\cdot{{100\\cdot101\\pi}\\over{100^2\\pi}}={101\\over200},$$and $m+n=\\boxed{301}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes m n :: real\nassumes h0 : \"gcd m n = 1\"\nand h1 : \"m / n = (\\<Sum> i = 2..100. i powr 2) / 100 powr 2\"\nshows  \"m + n = 301\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
