        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n We have a right triangle $\\triangle ABC$ where the legs $AB$ and $BC$ have lengths $6$ and $3\\sqrt{3},$ respectively. Medians $AM$ and $CN$ meet at point $P.$ What is the length of $CP$? The final Answer is $4$\n ### Proof\n First, it is probably a good idea to sketch our triangle: [asy] pair A, B, C, M, N, P; A = (0, 6); B = (0, 0); C = (5.196, 0); M = 0.5 * B + 0.5 * C; N = 0.5 * A + 0.5 * B; P = 0.66 * N + 0.34 * C; draw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(A--M); draw(C--N); label(\"$A$\", A, N); label(\"$B$\", B, SW); label(\"$C$\", C, SE); label(\"$M$\", M, NE); label(\"$N$\", N, NE); label(\"$P$\", P, SW); label(\"$6$\", A--B, W); label(\"$3\\sqrt{3}$\", B--C, S);\ndraw(rightanglemark(A,B,C,10)); [/asy] Since $P$ is the intersection of medians, it is the centroid of $\\triangle ABC.$ That means that the ratio of $CP:PN$ is $2:1.$ We can easily find $CN$ by using the right triangle $\\triangle CBN.$ Since $N$ is the midpoint of $AB,$ $BN = 3.$ At this point, we might recognize that $\\triangle CBN$ is a $30^\\circ-60^\\circ-90^\\circ$ triangle, which is handy since we can easily find $CN = 6.$ Therefore, $CP$ is $\\frac{2}{3}$ of $CN,$ or $\\boxed{4}.$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes A B C M N P :: \"real \\<Rightarrow> real\"\nassumes h0 : \"A B powr 2 + B C powr 2 = C A powr 2\"\nand h1 : \"A B = 6\"\nand h2 : \"B C = 3 * sqrt 3\"\nand h3 : \"M = midpoint A C\"\nand h4 : \"N = midpoint B C\"\nand h5 : \"P = intersection M N\"\nshows \"cmod (C P) = 4\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": " In a triangle ABC, the lengths of the sides AB, BC, and CA satisfy the equation $AB^2 + BC^2 = CA^2$. The length of AB is 6 units, and the length of BC is $3\\sqrt{3}$ units. A point M is the midpoint of AC, a point N is the midpoint of BC, and a point P is the intersection of the lines MN. Find the length of CP. The final answer is 4 units.",
