Then the horizontal and vertical lines together split the large rectangle into $\\emph{4}$ smaller rectangles. In addition, the vertical line by itself splits the large rectangle into $\\emph{2}$ rectangles and the horizontal line by itself splits the large rectangle into $\\emph{2}$ other rectangles.\nThere are $1+4+2+2=\\boxed{9}$ different rectangles in the figure.\n *)\n\n The given problem is a geometric problem that involves counting the number of rectangles in a figure.

        "informal problem": " The problem involves determining the number of rectangles present in a given geometric figure. To solve this mathematically, we consider the figure to be composed of 3 horizontal lines and 3 vertical lines. The total number of rectangles is calculated by finding the number of ways to select 2 lines from each set. This can be represented as the combination formula: $\\binom{3}{2} \\times \\binom{3}{2} = 9$. So, there are 9 rectangles in the figure.",
