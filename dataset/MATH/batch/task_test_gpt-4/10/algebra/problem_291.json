On Bob's turn, he flips a coin. If he gets a tails, he wins. If not, it becomes Alice's turn. What is the probability that Alice wins the game? The final Answer is \\frac{2}{3}\n ### Proof\n Alice has a $1/2$ chance of winning the game on her first turn. If she doesn't, then the probability that she wins the game on her second turn is $1/8,$ since she must not win on her first flip ($1/2$ chance), Bob must not win on his first flip ($1/2$ chance), and then Alice must win on her second flip ($1/2$ chance).\n The probability that she wins the game on her third turn is $1/32,$ and in general, the probability that she wins the game on her $k^\\text{th}$ turn is $(1/2)^{2k-1}.$ Thus, the probability that Alice wins is an infinite geometric series with first term $1/2$ and common ratio $1/4.$ So, the probability that Alice wins the game is $$\\frac{\\frac12}{1-\\frac14} = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}.$$OR\n Note that the only difference between the odds of Alice or Bob winning is who goes first. Because Bob goes second, the odds of him winning on his $k^\\text{th}$ flip is half of the odds that Alice wins on her $k^\\text{th}$ flip, since Alice must first get a tails before Bob gets a chance to win.\n Thus, if $a$ is Alice's chance of winning, and $b$ is Bob's chance of winning, then $a = 2b.$ Also, since someone must win, $a + b = 1.$ It follows that $a = 2/3$ and $b = 1/3,$ so Alice has a $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$ chance of winning the game.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes P_Alice_wins :: real and P_heads :: real and P_tails :: real\nassumes h0 : \"P_heads + P_tails = 1\"\nand h1 : \"P_Alice_wins = P_heads + (1 - P_heads) * (1 - P_tails) * P_Alice_wins\"\nshows  \"P_Alice_wins = 2 / 3\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "In a two-player game, Alice flips a biased coin that has a probability of landing heads with $P_{heads}$ and tails with $P_{tails}$. If the coin lands heads, Alice wins. If it lands tails, the coin is flipped again. Alice wins if the second flip is heads; otherwise, her opponent wins. The sum of the probabilities of heads and tails is 1. Find the probability of Alice winning the game, given that $P_{Alice\\_wins} = P_{heads} + (1 - P_{heads}) * (1 - P_{tails}) * P_{Alice\\_wins}$. The final answer is $\\frac{2}{3}$.",
