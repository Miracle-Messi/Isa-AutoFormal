Since triangles $\\triangle ABE$ and $\\triangle AEC$ have equal base length and share the same height, they have the same area. $\\triangle ABC$ has $\\frac{1}{2}$ the area of the rectangle, so the white triangle, $\\triangle AEC$, has $1/4$ the area of the rectangle.\n Hence the shaded region has $1 - \\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{3}{4}$ of the area of the rectangle, or $\\boxed{75} \\%$.\n *)\n\nThis problem involves geometry and graphical representation which can't be directly translated into Isabelle language.
