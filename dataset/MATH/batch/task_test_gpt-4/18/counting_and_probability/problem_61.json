        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n If two numbers are randomly chosen without replacement from $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$, what is the probability their sum is greater than their product? Express your answer as a common fraction. The final Answer is \\frac{2}{5}\n ### Proof\n Let $a$ and $b$ be positive integers. Observe that $ab-(a+b)=(a-1)(b-1)-1$. This quantity is non-negative unless either $a$ or $b$ equals 1.\n Therefore, the only pairs of positive integers for which the sum exceeds the product are those of the form $\\{1,n\\}$ where $n$ is a positive integer. In this case, there are 4 such pairs: $\\{1,2\\}$, $\\{1,3\\}$, $\\{1,4\\}$, and $\\{1,5\\}$.\n There are a total of $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ pairs of integers, so the probability that the sum exceeds the product is $\\frac{4}{10}=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes a b :: nat\nassumes h0 : \"finite {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\"\nand h1 : \"a \\<in> {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\"\nand h2 : \"b \\<in> {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\"\nand h3 : \"a \\<noteq> b\"\nand h4 : \"a + b > a * b\"\nshows  \"card { (a, b) | a b. a \\<in> {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} \\<and> b \\<in> {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} \\<and> a \\<noteq> b \\<and> a + b > a * b } / card {(a, b) | a b. a \\<in> {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} \\<and> b \\<in> {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} \\<and> a \\<noteq> b} = 2 / 5\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
