The final Answer is \\frac{2}{5}\n ### Proof\n There are ten ways for Tina to select a pair of numbers. The sums 9, 8, 4, and 3 can be obtained in just one way, and the sums 7, 6, and 5 can each be obtained in two ways. The probability for each of Sergio's choices is $1/10$.\n Considering his selections in decreasing order, the total probability of Sergio's choice being greater is \\begin{align} &\\left(\\frac{1}{10}\\right)\\left(1 + \\frac{9}{10} + \\frac{8}{10} + \\frac{6}{10} + \\frac{4}{10} + \\frac{2}{10} + \\frac{1}{10} + 0 + 0 + 0\n \\right) \\\\ & = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}. \\end{align}\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes tina Sergio :: \"real set\"\nand p :: \"real set \\<Rightarrow> real\"\nassumes h0 : \"tina = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\"\nand h1 : \"Sergio = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\"\nand h2 : \"\\<forall> n m. n \\<in> tina \\<and> m \\<in> tina \\<and> n \\<noteq> m \\<longrightarrow> p {s \\<in> Sergio. s > n + m} = 2 / 5\"\nshows  \"p {s \\<in> Sergio. s > (\\<Sum>n\\<in>tina. n)} = 2 / 5\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",

For any two distinct numbers $n$ and $m$ in Tina's set, the probability of picking a number from Sergio's set that is greater than the sum of $n$ and $m$ is $\\frac{2}{5}$. What is the probability of picking a number from Sergio's set that is greater than the sum of all the numbers in Tina's set?"
