Since $DH=2\\sqrt{2}$, these are equal to $\\sqrt{2}$.\n So $DG$ has length $2$, and as $CD$ has length $4$ this means that $CG$ has length $2$. Since angle $FGD$ is $45^{\\circ}$ and $e$ is a square, if we label the marked point on $BC$ as $J$ then angle $CGJ$ is $45^{\\circ}$.\n Thus triangle $CGJ$, the grey piece, is an isosceles right triangle, and one of its legs is $2$, so its area is $\\frac{2^2}{2}=\\boxed{2}$.\n *)\n\nUnfortunately, the problem you've provided involves geometric visualization and computation which currently the Isabelle proof assistant does not support directly.
