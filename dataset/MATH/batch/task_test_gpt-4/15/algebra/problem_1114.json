        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n At a certain amusement park, there is a bulk discount for tickets. If you buy up to 60 tickets in one order, the price for each ticket is $\\$70$. However if you buy more than 60 tickets in a single order, the price of every ticket is reduced by $\\$1$ for each additional ticket bought. If $t$ is the number of tickets bought in bulk at one time, what is the largest $t$ which will bring the amusement park a profit greater than $\\$4200$? The final Answer is 69\n ### Proof\n Letting $t$ equal the number of tickets sold in a single order, we get the following inequality: \\begin{align} 4200&<(70-(t-60))(t) \\\\4200&<(130-t)(t) \\\\4200&<130t-t^2 \\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad t^2-130t+4200&<0\n \\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad (t-60)(t-70)&<0 \\end{align}Since the two roots of the left-hand side are 60 and 70, the inequality must change sign at these two points. For $t<60$, both factors of the inequality are negative, thus making it positive.\n For $60<t<70$, only $t-70$ is negative, so the inequality is negative. Finally, for $t>70$, both factors are positive, making the inequality positive once again. This tells us that the range of $t$ that will result in a profit greater than $\\$4200$ is $(60,70)$.\n Since the number of tickets purchased in one order must be an integer, the largest number of tickets which brings a profit greater than $\\$4200$ is $t=\\boxed{69}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes t :: nat and profit bulk_price :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> int\"\nassumes h0 : \"\\<forall>t. t \\<le> 60 \\<longrightarrow> bulk_price t = 70\"\nand h1 : \"\\<forall>t. t > 60 \\<longrightarrow> bulk_price t = 70 - (t - 60)\"\nand h2 : \"profit t = t * bulk_price t\"\nand h3 : \"\\<forall>t. profit t > 4200 \\<longrightarrow> (\\<exists>k. t = k + 1)\"\nshows  \"t = 69\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
