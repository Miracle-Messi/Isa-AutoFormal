The final Answer is 66\n ### Proof\n The prime factorization of $210 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$.\n By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, it suffices to find the residues of $N$ modulo $5$, $6$, and $7$. Since the units digit of $N$ in base $6$ is equal to $0$, it follows that $N$ is divisible by $6$.
