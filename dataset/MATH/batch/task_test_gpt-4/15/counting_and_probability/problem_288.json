Isabelle is a formal proof management system and is not designed to handle visual problems or graphical representations.\n\nHowever, if we were to translate the problem into a mathematical problem that could be solved using Isabelle, we might rephrase it as follows:\n\n\"Consider a 3x3 grid with 9 squares. Each square is painted with one of n colors, where n is the number of colors used. The grid has two lines of symmetry: one vertical line of symmetry and one diagonal line of symmetry. What is the maximum value of n such that all squares can be uniquely colored respecting the symmetry constraints?\"\n\nThis problem can be solved mathematically by considering the constraints of the symmetries and the requirement for unique coloring. The answer is 3, as each color can only appear once in each row, column, and diagonal due to the symmetry lines.\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
