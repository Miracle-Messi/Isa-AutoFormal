What is the probability that in a randomly selected group of five students from the class, there will be two freshmen girls and three freshmen boys? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest thousandth. The final Answer is 0.076\n ### Proof\n We can choose 2 freshmen girls and 3 freshman boys in $\\binom{12}{2}\\binom{11}{3} = 10890$ ways. There are a total of $\\binom{30}{5} = 142506$ possible groups of 5 students we can choose.\n Thus the probability of selecting a group of 5 students with 2 freshman girls and 3 freshmen boys is $\\frac{10890}{142506} \\approx \\boxed{0.076}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes math_class :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> nat\"\nand freshmen_girls :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> nat\"\nand freshmen_boys :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> nat\"\nand total_students :: nat\nand total_girls :: nat\nand total_boys :: nat\nand group_students :: nat\nand freshmen_girls_in_group :: nat\nand freshmen_boys_in_group :: nat\nand probability :: real\nassumes h0 : \"total_students = 30\"\nand h1 : \"total_girls = 15\"\nand h2 : \"total_boys = 15\"\nand h3 : \"freshmen_girls total_girls = 12\"\nand h4 : \"freshmen_boys total_boys = 11\"\nand h5 : \"group_students = 5\"\nand h6 : \"freshmen_girls_in_group = 2\"\nand h7 : \"freshmen_boys_in_group = 3\"\nand h8 : \"probability = (\\<Prod> {factors})\"\nshows  \"probability = 0.076\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
