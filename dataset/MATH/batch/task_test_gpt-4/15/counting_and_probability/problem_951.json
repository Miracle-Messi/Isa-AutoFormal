The total value of these coins is 3 quarters * 25 cents (per quarter) + 3 nickels * 5 cents (per nickel) + 3 pennies * 1 cent (per penny) = 75 + 15 + 3 = 93 cents.\n\nThe problem also states that there are 3 coins with a value of 25 cents (quarters), 3 coins with a value of 5 cents (nickels), and 3 coins with a value of 1 cent (pennies). The total number of coins is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9.\n\nThe probability of picking a coin with a value of 25 cents (quarter), 5 cents (nickel), or 1 cent (penny) is calculated as the number of coins of that value divided by the total number of coins. So, the probability of picking a quarter is 3/9, a nickel is 3/9, and a penny is 3/9.\n\nThe problem asks to find the product of these probabilities, which is (3/9) * (3/9) * (3/9) = 3/28.",
