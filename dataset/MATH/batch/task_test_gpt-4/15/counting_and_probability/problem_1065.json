For all integers `i` in the range from 1 to 3 inclusive, the ratio of `(r - 2 * (i - 1))` squared times pi to `r` squared times pi is equal to the ratio of `(r - 2 * (i - 1))` squared to `r` squared.\n3.

The key idea is that for `i` from 1 to 3, the ratio of the area of a certain region (determined by `(r - 2 * (i - 1))` squared times pi) to the area of a circle with radius `r` (determined by `r` squared times pi) is the same as the ratio of the square of the distance from a point to the center of the circle (determined by `(r - 2 * (i - 1))` squared) to the square of the radius of the circle (determined by `r` squared), and this ratio is also equal to `1` minus the same ratio.\n\nIn simpler terms, the problem is about the relationship between the areas of three regions within a circle of radius 6, where the regions are defined by distances from the center of the circle that are `r - 2`, `r - 4`, and `r - 6` (corresponding to `i` values of 1, 2, and 3), and the areas are proportional to the squares of these distances. The problem states that the ratio of each region's area to the total area of the circle is the same as the ratio of the square of the distance defining the region to the square of the radius, and this ratio is also equal to `1` minus itself.",

For all integers `i` in the range from 1 to 3 inclusive, the ratio of `(r - 2 * (i - 1))` squared times pi to `r` squared times pi is equal to the ratio of `(r - 2 * (i - 1))` squared to `r` squared.\n3.

The key idea is that for `i` from 1 to 3, the ratio of the area of a certain region (determined by `(r - 2 * (i - 1))` squared times pi) to the area of a circle with radius `r` (determined by `r` squared times pi) is the same as the ratio of the square of the distance from a point to the center of the circle (determined by `(r - 2 * (i - 1))` squared) to the square of the radius of the circle (determined by `r` squared), and this ratio is also equal to `1` minus the same ratio.\n\nIn simpler terms, the problem is about the relationship between the areas of three regions within a circle of radius 6, where the regions are defined by distances from the center of the circle that are `r - 2`, `r - 4`, and `r - 6` (corresponding to `i` values of 1, 2, and 3), and the areas are proportional to the squares of these distances. The problem states that the ratio of each region's area to the total area of the circle is the same as the ratio of the square of the distance defining the region to the square of the radius, and this ratio is also equal to `1` minus itself.",
