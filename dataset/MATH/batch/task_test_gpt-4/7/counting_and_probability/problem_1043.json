(The positive integers $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are distinct.) The final Answer is 40\n ### Proof\n The prime factorization of $2310$ is $2310 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11.$ Therefore, we have the equation \\[ abc = 2310 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11,\\]where $a, b, c$ must be distinct positive integers and order does not matter.\n There are $3$ ways to assign each prime number on the right-hand side to one of the variables $a, b, c,$ which gives $3^5 = 243$ solutions for $(a, b, c).$ However, three of these solutions have two $1$s and one $2310,$ which contradicts the fact that $a, b, c$ must be distinct.\n Because each prime factor appears only once, all other solutions have $a, b, c$ distinct. Correcting for this, we get $243 - 3 = 240$ ordered triples $(a, b, c)$ where $a, b, c$ are all distinct. Finally, since order does not matter, we must divide by $3!,$ the number of ways to order $a, b, c.$ This gives the final answer, \\[\\frac{240}{3!}\n = \\frac{240}{6} = \\boxed{40}.\\]\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes count :: nat and P :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> nat \\<Rightarrow> nat \\<Rightarrow> bool\"\nassumes h0 : \"\\<forall> a b c.
