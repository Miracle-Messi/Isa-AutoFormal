    "natural problem": "A parabola with equation $y=ax^2+bx+c$ contains the points $(-3,3)$, $(1,3)$, and $(0,0)$.  Find the value $100a+10b+c$.",
    "natural solution": [
        "Since the points $(-3,3)$ and $(1,3)$ have the same $y$-value, the axis of symmetry of the parabola must be between these 2 points. The $x$-value halfway between $-3$ and $1$ is $x=-1$.",
        "Therefore the vertex of the parabola is equal to $(-1,k)$ for some $k$ and the parabola may also be written as  \\[a(x+1)^2+k.\\] Now we substitute. The point $(1,3)$ gives  \\[3=a(1+1)^2+k,\\] or  \\[4a+k=3.\\] The point $(0,0)$ gives  \\[0=a(0+1)^2+k\\] or  \\[a+k=0.\\] Subtracting the second equation from the first gives  \\[(4a+k)-(a+k)=3-0\\] so $3a=3$, giving $a=1$.",
        "Since $a=1$ and $a+k=0$ we know that $k=-1$ and our parabola is  \\[ax^2+bx+c=(x+1)^2-1.\\] In order to compute $100a+10b+c$ we can substitute $x=10$ and that gives  \\[100a+10b+c=(10+1)^2-1=\\boxed{120}.\\]"
