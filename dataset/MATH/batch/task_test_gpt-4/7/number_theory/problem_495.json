The final Answer is 108\n ### Proof\n Both $a$ and $b$ must be divisible by $6$, so the choices for $a$ are $$12, 42, 72, 102, 132, \\ldots\\phantom{~. }$$and the choices for $b$ are $$24, 54, 84, 114, 144, \\ldots~.$$We know that $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]\\cdot \\gcd(a,b)=ab$ (since this identity holds for all positive integers $a$ and $b$).\n Therefore, $$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = \\frac{ab}{6},$$so in order to minimize $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]$, we should make $ab$ as small as possible. But we can't take $a=12$ and $b=24$, because then $\\gcd(a,b)$ would be $12$, not $6$.\n The next best choice is either $a=12,b=54$ or $a=42,b=24$. Either of these pairs yields $\\gcd(a,b)=6$ as desired, but the first choice, $a=12$ and $b=54$, yields a smaller product.\n Hence this is the optimal choice, and the smallest possible value for $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]$ is $$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[12,54] = \\frac{12\\cdot 54}{6} = 2\\cdot 54 = \\boxed{108}.$$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes a b :: nat\nassumes h0 : \"a mod 10 = 2\"\nand h1 : \"b mod 10 = 4\"\nand h2 : \"gcd a b = 6\"\nshows  \"lcm a b = (LEAST l. \\<exists> a b. a mod 10 = 2 \\<and> b mod 10 = 4 \\<and> gcd a b = 6 \\<and> lcm a b = l)\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "Find the least common multiple (LCM) of two natural numbers $a$ and $b$, given that $a$ modulo $10$ is $2$, $b$ modulo $10$ is $4$, and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $a$ and $b$ is $6$. The final answer is the smallest LCM that satisfies these conditions."
