        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n Given that a particular positive integer is a four-digit palindrome, what is the probability that it is a multiple of $99?$ Express your answer as a common fraction. The final Answer is \\frac19\n ### Proof\n First we find the number of $4$ digit palindromes. There are ten palindromes for every distinct thousandth digit from $1$ to $9$ because there are $10$ numbers from $0$ to $9$ we could pick for the second and third digit.\n This gives us a total of $9 \\cdot 10$ palindromes. Next, we can get that all palindromes are multiples of $11$. The divisibility rule for $11$ tells us that for a number $abcd$ to be divisible by $11$, then $a-b+c-d$ is divisible by $11$.\n Since $a=d$ and $b=c$, $a-b+c-d$ is always divisible by $11$ so all four digit palindromes are divisible by $11$.\n Now we want to find now many of these palindromes are divisible by $9$.
