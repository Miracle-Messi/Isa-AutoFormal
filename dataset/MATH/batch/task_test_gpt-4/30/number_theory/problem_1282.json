If a beaded lizard requires 94 green beads and 16 red beads, what is the number of green beads left over? The final Answer is 109\n ### Proof\n We have $476+104+281 \\equiv 6+10+93 \\equiv 109 \\pmod{94}\\equiv 15\\pmod{94}$. There are, however, only $32+16+80$ red beads, which is only enough to make $\\frac{32+16+80}{16} = 2+1+5 = 8$ lizards, and $476+104+281 = 15+94\\cdot 9$.\n Therefore, after the $8$ possible lizards are made, there are $15+94=\\boxed{109}$ green beads left over.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes beads_lizard green_beads red_beads :: nat\nassumes h0 : \"beads_lizard = 94\"\nand h1 : \"green_beads = 476 + 104 + 281\"\nand h2 : \"red_beads = 32 + 16 + 80\"\nand h3 : \"green_beads div beads_lizard = red_beads div 16\"\nshows  \"green_beads mod beads_lizard = 109\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "A lizard has a total of 94 beads. The number of green beads is the sum of 476, 104, and 281. The number of red beads is the sum of 32, 16, and 80. If the number of green beads divided by the total beads the lizard has is equal to the number of red beads divided by 16, find the remainder when the number of green beads is divided by the total beads the lizard has. The final answer is 109."
