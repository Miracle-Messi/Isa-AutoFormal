Express your answer as a common fraction. The final Answer is \\frac{3}{2}\n ### Proof\n Since point $A$ is constrained to a rectangular region with sides parallel to the axes, its $x$ and $y$ coordinates can be chosen independently of one another. The same is true of point $B$.\n Therefore, the horizontal separation between $A$ and $B$ should be minimized and the vertical separation maximized. The greatest possible $y$-coordinate for $B$ is 3 and the least possible $y$-coordinate for $A$ is 0.\n The greatest possible $x$-coordinate for $A$ is 2 and the least possible $x$-coordinate for $B$ is 4.\n Therefore, the slope between $A$ and $B$ is maximized when $A$ has coordinates (2,0) and $B$ has coordinates (4,3). The maximum slope is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes slope :: real and A B :: \"real * real\"\nassumes h0 : \"A \\<in> {(x, y) | x y. 0 \\<le> x \\<and> x \\<le> 2 \\<and> 0 \\<le> y \\<and> y \\<le> 2}\"\nand h1 : \"B \\<in> {(x, y) | x y. 4 \\<le> x \\<and> x \\<le> 5 \\<and> 2 \\<le> y \\<and> y \\<le> 3}\"\nand h2 : \"slope = (snd B - snd A) / (fst B - fst A)\"\nshows  \"slope = 3 / 2\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
