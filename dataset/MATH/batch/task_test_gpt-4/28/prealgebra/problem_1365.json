After the new building is built, the shortest of these, which was 625 feet tall, is replaced as a member of the five tallest buildings, which, since it is 885 feet tall, is $885-625 = 260$ feet taller.\n Therefore the sum of the heights of the five tallest buildings increases by 260 feet, to $3665 + 260 = 3925$ feet. This means that the new mean height of the 5 tallest buildings is $\\frac{3925}{5}=785$ feet, so the mean has increased by $785-733=\\boxed{52}$ feet.\n Note that this amount is just the difference in the height of the two buildings divided by 5.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes mean_height_old mean_height_new tallest_old shortest_old new_building :: real\nassumes h0 : \"mean_height_old = (tallest_old + shortest_old + 3 * (733)) / 5\"\nand h1 : \"mean_height_new = (tallest_old + shortest_old + new_building + 2 * (733)) / 5\"\nshows  \"mean_height_new - mean_height_old = 52\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
