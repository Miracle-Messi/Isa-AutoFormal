        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n There are two distinct solutions $x$ to the equation $18+5x^2=20x$. If each solution is rounded to the nearest integer, and then these two integers are multiplied together, what is the result? The final Answer is 3\n ### Proof\n First, we rearrange the equation so that one side is a quadratic written in the usual way and the other side is $0$.\n We can do this by subtracting $20x$ from each side (and reordering the terms): $$5x^2-20x+18 = 0$$This doesn't factor in any obvious way, so we apply the quadratic formula, which gives \\begin{align} x = \\frac{-(-20)\\pm \\sqrt{(-20)^2-4(5)(18)}}{2(5)} &= \\frac{20\\pm \\sqrt{400-360}}{10} \\\\\n &= \\frac{20\\pm \\sqrt{40}}{10} \\\\ &= 2\\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{40}}{10}. \\end{align}We observe that $\\sqrt{40}$ is between $6$ and $7$, so $\\frac{\\sqrt{40}}{10}$ is between $0.6$ and $0.7$.\n Thus one of our solutions is between $1.3$ and $1.4$, while the other is between $2.6$ and $2.7$. Rounding each solution to the nearest integer, we get $1$ and $3$, the product of which is $\\boxed{3}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes x :: real\nassumes h0 : \"18 + 5 * x powr 2 = 20 * x\"\nshows  \"\\<exists>x1 x2. x1 \\<noteq> x2 \\<and> round x1 * round x2 = 3\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
