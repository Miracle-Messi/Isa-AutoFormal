        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n Kendra has an unlimited supply of unbreakable sticks of length 2, 4 and 6 inches. Using these sticks, how many non-congruent triangles can she make if each side is made with a whole stick? Two sticks can be joined only at a vertex of the triangle. (A triangle with sides of lengths 4, 6, 6 is an example of one such triangle to be included, whereas a triangle with sides of lengths 2, 2, 4 should not be included.) The final Answer is 7\n ### Proof\n To start, we can make three equilateral triangles, with sides $2,2,2$, $4,4,4$ and $6,6,6$. Next, look at isosceles triangles. If two sides have length 6, the remaining side could be $2$ since $6+2>6$ and $6+6>2$.\n The remaining side could also be 4 since $6+4>6$ and $6+6>4$.\n So, this is two more triangles. If two sides have length 4, the remaining side could have length $6$ since $6+4>4$ and $4+4>6$. The remaining side could also have length 2 since $2+4>4$ and $4+4>2$. There are no possible triangles with all sides of different length, since $2+4=6$.\n Thus, there are a total of $\\boxed{7}$ non congruent triangles.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes a b c :: nat\nassumes h0 : \"a \\<in> {2, 4, 6}\"\nand h1 : \"b \\<in> {2, 4, 6}\"\nand h2 : \"c \\<in> {2, 4, 6}\"\nand h3 : \"a + b > c \\<and> a + c > b \\<and> b + c > a\"\nshows  \"card {(a, b, c).
