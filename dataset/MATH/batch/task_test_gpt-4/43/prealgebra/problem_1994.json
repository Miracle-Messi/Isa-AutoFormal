The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \\begin{align} (5)\\cdot (11) \\cdot (13) &= 5\\cdot 11\\cdot 13 \\\\\n (5\\cdot11)\\cdot 13&=55\\cdot 13 \\\\ 5\\cdot(11\\cdot 13) &= 5\\cdot 143 \\\\ (5\\cdot 13) \\cdot 11 &= 65 \\cdot 11\\text{, and}\\\\ (5\\cdot11\\cdot13)&=715, \\end{align} where the last one is a product with only one factor.\n Since the letters cannot represent numbers greater than 26, only $5\\cdot11\\cdot 13$ could come from calculating the product value of a word. The 5th, 11th, and 13th letters of the alphabet are E, K, and M.  Since E, K, and M do not form a word, we introduce the letter A (which doesn't affect the product since its value is 1) to form the word $\\boxed{\\text{MAKE}}$.\n *)\n\nThis problem cannot be translated directly into an Isabelle theorem because it involves searching for a word in the English language, which is not a function that Isabelle can perform. The problem is more of a combinatorial problem that requires knowledge of the English language, not a mathematical theorem that can be proven or disproven using Isabelle. \n\nHowever, we can define a product function for the word in Isabelle.\n\nHere is a possible representation of the underlying mathematical structure in Isabelle:\n\n```\nfun letter_val :: \"char \u21d2 int\" where\n\"letter_val a = 1\" |\n\"letter_val b = 2\" |\n...\n\"letter_val z = 26\"\n\nfun word_val :: \"string \u21d2 int\" where\n\"word_val [] = 1\" |\n\"word_val (x#xs) = letter_val x * word_val xs\"\n\ntheorem MAKE_val: \"word_val \"MAKE\" = 715\"\n```\n\nThis Isabelle code first defines a function that assigns a value to each letter. Then it defines a function that calculates the product of the values of the letters in a word. The final theorem states that the product of the values of the letters in the word \"MAKE\" is 715.\n\nPlease note that this code does not actually work in Isabelle as it does not support the string datatype in a way that allows for this kind of string manipulation. This code is purely for illustrative purposes.\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
