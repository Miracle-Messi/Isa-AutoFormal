        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n Consider the sequence of numbers: $4,7,1,8,9,7,6,\\dots$ For $n>2$, the $n$-th term of the sequence is the units digit of the sum of the two previous terms. Let $S_n$ denote the sum of the first $n$ terms of this sequence. Find the smallest value of $n$ for which $S_n>10,000.$ The final Answer is 1999\n ### Proof\n Writing out further terms of the sequence, we get \\[4, 7, 1, 8, 9, 7, 6, 3, 9, 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, \\dots.\\]Since each term depends only on the previous two terms, the sequence becomes periodic at this point, with period 12.\n Since $S_{12} = 60,$ $S_{12k} = 60k$ for all positive integers $k.$  Taking $k = 166,$ we get \\[S_{1992} = 60 \\cdot 166 = 9960.\\]Then $S_{1998} = 9996$ and $S_{1999} = 10002,$ so the smallest such $n$ is $\\boxed{1999}.$\n *)\n\nprimrec seq :: \"nat \u21d2 nat\"\nwhere\n\"seq 1 = 4\" |\n\"seq 2 = 7\" |\n\"seq n = (seq (n-1) + seq (n-2)) mod 10\"\n\nprimrec S :: \"nat \u21d2 nat\"\nwhere\n\"S 0 = 0\" |\n\"S n = S (n-1) + seq n\"\n\ntheorem\nshows  \"(LEAST n.
