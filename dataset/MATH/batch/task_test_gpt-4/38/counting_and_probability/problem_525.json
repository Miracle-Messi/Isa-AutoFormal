Case 2: Rosa is three seats from Pierre (that is, there are $2$ seats between them). There are $2$ such seats. Thomas can't sit in either of the $2$ seats directly between them, but after Rosa sits, there are $3$ empty seats in a row still, and Thomas can only sit in the middle seat of these three.\n Once again, there are $4$ empty seats remaining, and the $4$ remaining people can sit in them in $4! = 24$ ways.\n So, we have $2\\cdot 24 = 48$ seatings in this case. Putting our two cases together gives a total of $96+48 = \\boxed{144}$ seatings.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes n :: nat\nassumes h0 : \"n = 7\"\nand h1 : \"Pierre \\<noteq> Rosa \\<and> Pierre \\<noteq> Thomas \\<and> Rosa \\<noteq> Thomas\"\nand h2 : \"\\<forall> p1 p2 p3. p1 \\<noteq> Pierre \\<and> p1 \\<noteq> Rosa \\<and> p1 \\<noteq> Thomas \\<and> p2 \\<noteq> Pierre \\<and> p2 \\<noteq> Rosa \\<and> p2 \\<noteq> Thomas \\<and> p3 \\<noteq> Pierre \\<and> p3 \\<noteq> Rosa \\<and> p3 \\<noteq> Thomas \\<longrightarrow> (Pierre, p1, Rosa, p2, Thomas, p3) \\<noteq> (Rosa, p1, Thomas, p2, Pierre, p3)\"\nshows  \"number_of_ways = 144\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are part of a group of 7 people who need to sit in a row. Pierre cannot sit next to Rosa, and Rosa cannot sit next to Thomas. In how many ways can the 7 people be arranged? The final answer is 144."
