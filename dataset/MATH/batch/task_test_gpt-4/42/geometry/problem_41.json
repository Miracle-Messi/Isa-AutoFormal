Since $AC = 15,$ that means $CQ = 5,$ since the median from $C$ to $BD$ is half the length of $AC,$ or $7.5,$ and $CQ$ must be $\\frac{2}{3}$ of that, or $5.$ Therefore, $QA = AC - CQ = 15 - 5 = \\boxed{10}.$\n Solution 2: Since $ABCD$ is a parallelogram, $\\overline{AD}$ and $\\overline{BC}$ are parallel with $\\overline{AC}$ and $\\overline{DN}$ as transversals.\n So $\\angle DAQ = \\angle NCQ$ and $\\angle ADQ = \\angle CNQ$, and so $\\triangle ADQ$ and $\\triangle CNQ$ are similar by AA similarity. Also, we know opposite sides of a parallelogram are congruent, so $AD = BC$.\n Since $N$ is a midpoint of $\\overline{BC}$, we have $CN = \\dfrac{AD}2$.\n By similar triangles, \\[ \\dfrac{AQ}{CQ} = \\dfrac{AD}{CN} = 2, \\]so $AQ = 2CQ.$  Since $AQ + CQ = AC = 15$, we have $CQ = 5$ and $AQ = \\boxed{10}.$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes A B C D M N P Q :: \"real^2\" and s :: \"real \\<Rightarrow> real^2 \\<Rightarrow> real^2\"\nassumes h0 : \"is_midpoint M A B\"\nand h1 : \"is_midpoint N B C\"\nand h2 : \"is_intersection P D M A C\"\nand h3 : \"is_intersection Q D N A C\"\nand h4 : \"distance A C = 15\"\nshows  \"distance Q A = 10\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",

The lines DM and AC intersect at point P, and the lines DN and AC intersect at point Q. If the distance from A to C is 15 units, find the distance from Q to A. The final answer is 10 units."
