        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n Fake gold bricks are made by covering concrete cubes with gold paint, so the cost of the paint is proportional to their surface area while the cost of the concrete is proportional to their volume.  If a 1 inch cube costs $\\$1.30$ to make while a 2 inch cube costs $\\$6.80$, then how much would a 3 inch cube cost? The final Answer is \\$18.90\n ### Proof\n Let $x$ be the cost per square inch of gold paint, and let $y$ be the cost per cubic inch of concrete. Since a 1 inch cube has surface area 6 $\\text{in}^2$ and volume 1 $\\text{in}^3$ its total price will be $6x+y$ dollars.\n Similarly, a 2 inch cube has surface area 24 $\\text{in}^2$ and volume 8 $\\text{in}^3$, so its total price will be $24x+8y$ dollars.\n We are given that \\begin{align} 6x+y &=\\$1.30 \\\\ 24x+8y&= \\$6.80 \\end{align} Subtracting 4 times the first equation from the second gives $4y=\\$1.60$, so $y=\\$0.40$.\n Hence $6x=\\$0.90$, so $x=\\$0.15$. Since a 3 inch cube has surface area 54 $\\text{in}^2$ and volume 27 $\\text{in}^3$, its total price will be a total of $54(\\$0.15)+27(\\$0.40)=\\boxed{\\$18.90}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes cost_cube1 cost_cube2 cost_cube3 :: real\nassumes h0 : \"cost_cube1 = 1.30\"\nand h1 : \"cost_cube2 = 6.80\"\nand h2 : \"cost_cube1 * (2 powr 3) = cost_cube2 * (1 powr 3)\"\nshows  \"cost_cube3 = 18.90\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "A cube costs $1.30, and another cube costs $6.80. If the first cube's volume is eight times the second cube's volume, find the cost of a third cube which has a volume equal to the sum of the first two cubes' volumes. The final answer is $18.90."
