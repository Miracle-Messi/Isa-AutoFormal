How many pennies did Betty originally have?\n\nNote: An $a \\times b$ rectangle is considered the same as a $b \\times a$ rectangle. The final Answer is 45\n ### Proof\n Let the number of pennies that Betty has be $n.$ If after adding two more pennies, Betty can only arrange the pennies in a straight line, then $n+2$ must be prime. Since all primes greater than $2$ are odd, $n$ must be odd as well.\n Because she can arrange $n$ pennies in three different ways, $n$ must have four factors other than $1$ and itself.\n Hence we examine the odd numbers between $40$ and $50:$ $\\bullet$ $41$ factors as $1 \\cdot 41$ only. $\\bullet$ $43$ factors as $1 \\cdot 43$ only. $\\bullet$ $45$ factors as $1 \\cdot 45$ or $3 \\cdot 15$ or $5 \\cdot 9$.\n $\\bullet$ $47$ factors as $1 \\cdot 47$ only. $\\bullet$ $49$ factors as $1 \\cdot 49$ or $7 \\cdot 7$. The only number with four factors other than $1$ or itself is $45.$ If we add $2$ to $45,$ we get $47,$ which is indeed prime.\n Hence, Betty has $\\boxed{45}$ pennies.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes P :: \"int \\<Rightarrow> int set\"\nassumes h0 : \"P = {x. 40 <= x & x <= 50 & (\\<exists> a b. a * b = x & a \\<noteq> b)}\"\nand h1 : \"card (P n) = 3\"\nand h2 : \"card (P (n + 2)) = 1\"\nshows  \"n = 45\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",

If the number of elements in $P$ for a certain integer $n$ is 3 and for $n+2$ is 1, what is the value of $n$? The final answer is 45."
