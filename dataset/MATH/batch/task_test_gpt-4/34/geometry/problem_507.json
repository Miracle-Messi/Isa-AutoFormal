        "informal problem": "Consider a finite set S of real numbers with 4 elements, where each element l in S is equal to 2. Now, consider a function 'square' which takes two real numbers x and y and multiplies them. Also, consider that for every element l in S, there are real numbers x and y such that their product equals l. \n\nNext, divide every element l in S by 2 and call these new numbers 'midpoints'. The set of these midpoints is also finite and has 4 elements. \n\nNow, sum up the squares of all the midpoints (i.e., square each midpoint with itself and then add them all up), and let the sum be k. \n\nThe task is to find a relationship between k and some other number. The final conclusion is that 100 times k equals 86."
