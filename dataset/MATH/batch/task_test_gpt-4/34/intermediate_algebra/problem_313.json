        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n Suppose $f(x) = -x^2+3x+4$ and $g(x) = -2x^3+9x^2-x-12$. Every root of $f(x)$ is also a root of $g(x)$. What is the third root of $g(x)$ (that is not a root of $f(x)$)? The final Answer is \\frac{3}{2}\n ### Proof\n Since the roots of $f(x)$ are roots of $g(x)$, and $\\deg f < \\deg g$, we guess that $f(x)$ is a factor of $g(x)$. In other words, we guess that we can write $g(x) = f(x)q(x)$ for some polynomial $q(x)$.\n If that is the case, then any root of $f(x)$ will also be a root of $g(x)$.\n Dividing $g(x)$ by $f(x)$ gives us $$-2x^3+9x^2-x-12=(-x^2+3x+4)(2x-3)$$so we can see that $x = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$ is the third root of $g(x)$. It is also easy to verify that $-1$ and $4$ are roots of both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ (the roots can be found by factoring $f(x)$).\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes x :: real and f g :: \"real \\<Rightarrow> real\"\nassumes h0 : \"\\<forall> x. f x = -x powr 2 + 3 * x + 4\"\nand h1 : \"\\<forall> x. g x = -2 * x powr 3 + 9 * x powr 2 - x - 12\"\nand h2 : \"\\<forall> x. f x = 0 \\<longrightarrow> g x = 0\"\nshows  \"\\<exists> x. g x = 0 \\<and> f x \\<noteq> 0 \\<and> x = 3 / 2\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
