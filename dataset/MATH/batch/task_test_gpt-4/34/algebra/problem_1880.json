        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n If $s$ is an integer and the root(s) of the quadratic expression $\\frac{1}{2}x^2+sx-\\frac{1}{2}$ are integers, find the sum of all possible values of $s$. The final Answer is 0\n ### Proof\n By the quadratic equation, the roots of the equation are  \\begin{align} \\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}&=\\frac{-s\\pm\\sqrt{s^2-4(\\frac{1}{2})(-\\frac{1}{2})}}{2(\\frac{1}{2})}\\\\ &=\\frac{-s\\pm\\sqrt{s^2+1}}{1}=-s\\pm\\sqrt{s^2+1}.\n \\end{align} Thus we know that $-s+\\sqrt{s^2+1}$ and $-s-\\sqrt{s^2+1}$ are integers.\n We know that $s$ is an integer, so in order for the sum to be an integer, we must have that $\\sqrt{s^2+1}$ is an integer.\n Let $\\sqrt{s^2+1}=n$ for some integer $n$. Then we have $s^2+1=n^2$, or $n^2-s^2=1$ and thus $$(n-s)(n+s)=1.$$ Since $n$ and $s$ are both integers, then their sum and difference must also both be integers, so they are either both $1$ or both $-1$ since their product is 1.\n In either case, $n-s=n+s$, so $2s=0$ and $s=0$. This is the only value of $s$ for which $\\sqrt{s^2+1}$ is an integer, and thus the only value of $s$ that makes the roots of the given quadratic integers, so $s=\\boxed{0}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes x s :: int and roots :: \"int \\<Rightarrow> int\"\nassumes h0 : \"\\<forall> x. roots x = (1 div 2) * x ^ 2 + s * x - (1 div 2)\"\nand h1 : \"\\<forall> x. is_root roots x \\<longrightarrow> (\\<exists> k :: int. x = k)\"\nshows  \"sum_list (map (\\<lambda> s. if (\\<forall> x. is_root roots x) then s else 0) [s_min..s_max]) = 0\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
