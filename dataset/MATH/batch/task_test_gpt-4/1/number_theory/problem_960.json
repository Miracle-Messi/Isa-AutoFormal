Camera B starts recording at 7:00 am and records an additional 7 minutes every hour. Find a time where both cameras have recorded the same amount of footage but the next minute they record will be past 12:00 pm. Additionally, there should be 41 minutes remaining until 12:00 pm from the time both cameras have recorded the same amount of footage."

        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n There are two cameras that take pictures of a traffic intersection. Camera A starts taking pictures at $6$ AM and takes a picture every $11$ minutes. Camera B starts taking pictures at $7$ AM and takes pictures every $7$ minutes. Camera A and Camera B take a picture at the same time at four different times before noon. When Camera A and Camera B take their last picture together, how many minutes before noon is it? The final Answer is 41\n ### Proof\n If Camera A and Camera B take a picture at the same time, they will take a picture $77$ minutes later at the same time.\n Therefore, if we can find the first time they take a picture together, then we can continue adding $77$ minutes to figure out when the fourth picture was taken. Camera A's first pictures after $7$ AM is at $7:06$, followed by $7:17$ and $7:28$.\n Camera B will take a picture at $7:28$.\n From here, we add $77$ minutes until we have taken four pictures. $7:28$ is followed by $8:45$, which is followed by $10:02$, which is followed by $11:19$. This is $\\boxed{41}$ minutes before noon.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes minutes_before_noon :: real\nassumes h0 : \"minutes_before_noon = 720 - (lcm (66, 60) * 4)\"\nshows  \"minutes_before_noon = 41\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
