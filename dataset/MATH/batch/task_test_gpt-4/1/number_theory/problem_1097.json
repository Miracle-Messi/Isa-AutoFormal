        "informal problem": "Given that $a = 85$, $b = 49479$, $c = -67$, $d = 12000003$, and $e = -3$. Also, $a$ when divided by 7 doesn't give a remainder of 3, while $b$, $c$, and $e$ when divided by 7 all give a remainder of 3. However, $d$ when divided by 7 doesn't give a remainder of 3. What is the sum of $a$ and $d$? The final answer is $12000085$."
