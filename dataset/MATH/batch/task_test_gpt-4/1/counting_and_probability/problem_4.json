How many students at the school play on exactly two teams? The final Answer is 14\n ### Proof\n We have enough information to solve for the size of each team. There are $\\dfrac{60}{2}=30$ members of the basketball team, $\\dfrac{4}{3}(30)=40$ members of the math team, and $\\dfrac{2}{3}(30)=20$ members of the soccer team.\n Adding these up gives us 90, so clearly we're overcounting since there are only 60 students. The number of times that each student is counted in this total is equal to the number of teams that student plays on.\n This means that all 60 students will be counted at least once, all students who play exactly two sports will be counted one extra time, and all students who play three sports will be counted two extra times.\n Letting $x$ be the number of students who play two sports and $y$ be the number who play all three gives us $60+x+2y=90$.\n However, we know that $y=8$, so we can substitute that in and get $x=\\boxed{14}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes basketball soccer mathletics total :: nat\nassumes h0 : \"total = 60\"\nand h1 : \"basketball = total div 2\"\nand h2 : \"mathletics = 4 * (basketball div 3)\"\nand h3 : \"soccer = 2 * (basketball div 3)\"\nand h4 : \"8 students play all three sports\"\nand h5 : \"all students play at least one sport\"\nshows  \"number_of_students_playing_exactly_two_sports = 14\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "In a school, there are 60 students who play at least one of three sports: basketball, soccer, and mathletics. Half of the students play basketball, and one-third of those who play basketball also play soccer and mathletics. Additionally, the number of students who play mathletics is four times the number who play all three sports, while the number of students who play soccer is twice the number who play all three sports. If 8 students play all three sports, how many students play exactly two sports? The final answer is 14."
