        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n I have a spinner that lands on 1 with a probability of $\\frac{1}{10}$, 2 with a probability of $\\frac{2}{10}$, 3 with a probability of $\\frac{3}{10}$, and 4 with a probability of $\\frac{4}{10}$. If Phil and Sarah both spin the spinner, what is the probability that they get the same number? The final Answer is \\dfrac{3}{10}\n ### Proof\n This problem requires a little bit of casework. There are four ways in which they can both get the same number: if they both get 1's, both get 2's, both get 3's or both get 4's. The probability of getting a 1 is $\\dfrac{1}{10}$, so the probability that they will both spin a 1 is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{10}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{1}{100}$.\n Similarly, the probability of getting a 2 is $\\dfrac{2}{10}$, so the probability that they will both spin a 2 is $\\left(\\dfrac{2}{10}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{4}{100}$, the probability of getting a 3 is $\\dfrac{3}{10}$, so the probability that they will both get a 3 is $\\left(\\dfrac{3}{10}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{9}{100}$ and the probability of getting a 4 is $\\dfrac{4}{10}$, so the probability that they will both get a 4 is $\\left(\\dfrac{4}{10}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{16}{100}$.\n So our answer is $\\dfrac{1}{100}+\\dfrac{4}{100}+\\dfrac{9}{100}+\\dfrac{16}{100}=\\frac{30}{100}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{10}}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes p1 p2 p3 p4 :: real\nassumes h0 : \"p1 = 1 / 10\"\nand h1 : \"p2 = 2 / 10\"\nand h2 : \"p3 = 3 / 10\"\nand h3 : \"p4 = 4 / 10\"\nshows  \"p1 * p1 + p2 * p2 + p3 * p3 + p4 * p4 = 3 / 10\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
