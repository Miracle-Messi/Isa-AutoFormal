The final Answer is (128,2)\n ### Proof\n Since the quadratic has only one solution, the discriminant must be equal to zero. The discriminant is $b^2-4ac=1024-4ac=0$, so $ac=\\frac{1024}{4}=256$.\n We need to find $a$ and $c$ given $a+c=130$ and $ac=256$.\n We could write a quadratic equation and solve, but instead we rely on clever algebraic manipulations: Since $a+c=130$, we have $$(a+c)^2=a^2+c^2+2ac=130^2=16900.$$We subtract $4ac=1024$ from each side to find $$a^2+c^2+2ac-4ac=a^2+c^2-2ac=16900-1024=15876.$$We recognize each side as a square, so we take the square root of both sides: $$\\sqrt{a^2+c^2-2ac}=\\sqrt{(a-c)^2}=a-c=\\sqrt{15876}=126.$$(Technically we should take the positive and negative square root of both sides, but since $a>c$ we know $a-c>0$.)\n Thus we have  \\begin{align} a-c&=126\\\\ a+c&=130 \\end{align}Summing these equations gives \\begin{align} 2a&=256\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad a&=128, \\end{align}and $c=130-a=2$.\n Thus our ordered pair $(a,c)$ is $\\boxed{(128,2)}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes a c x :: real\nassumes h0 : \"a * x ^ 2 + 32 * x + c = 0\"\nand h1 : \"a + c = 130\"\nand h2 : \"a > c\"\nand h3 : \"\\<exists>! x. a * x ^ 2 + 32 * x + c = 0\"\nshows  \"(a, c) = (128, 2)\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
