This is equal to the number of pairs of meerkats that don't include Max.\n To form such a pair, we can choose the first (non-Max) meerkat in $9$ ways and the second in $8$ ways, but again, this overcounts by a factor of $2$. The number of pairs without Max is thus $(9\\cdot 8)/2$, which is $\\boxed{36}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes total_meerkats guard_meerkats nights_of_sleep :: nat\nassumes h0 : \"total_meerkats = 10\"\nand h1 : \"guard_meerkats = 2\"\nand h2 : \"total_meerkats choose guard_meerkats = total_meerkats * (total_meerkats - 1) div 2\"\nand h3 : \"nights_of_sleep = total_meerkats - (total_meerkats choose guard_meerkats)\"\nshows  \"nights_of_sleep = 36\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "Assuming a group of meerkats consists of 10 members and every night, 2 meerkats are chosen to guard the group. The number of possible ways to choose the guard meerkats is calculated by the formula total_meerkats choose guard_meerkats = total_meerkats * (total_meerkats - 1) div 2. Now, if each set of guard meerkats can guard for one night and the total nights of sleep for the group is calculated by subtracting the number of possible ways of choosing guard meerkats from the total number of meerkats. What is the total number of nights the meerkats group can sleep? The final answer is 36 nights."
