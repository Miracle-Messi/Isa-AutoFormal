The $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $\\frac{-b}{2a}=\\frac{-(-8)}{2(1)}=4$.\n To find the $y$-coordinate, we plug in $x=4$ to find $y=4^2-8\\cdot 4+5=16-32+5=-11$.\n So one vertex of the triangle is at $(4, -11)$. The other two vertices are on the intersection of the parabola $y=x^2-8x+5$ and the line $y=k$.\n Thus we have $x^2-8x+5=k$ or $x^2-8x+(5-k)=0$.\n By the quadratic formula, the solutions to this equation are  \\begin{align} \\frac{-(-8)\\pm\\sqrt{(-8)^2-4(1)(5-k)}}{2(1)}&=\\frac{8\\pm\\sqrt{64-20+4k}}{2}\\\\ &=4\\pm\\sqrt{11+k}. \\end{align}So the two other vertices of the triangle are $(4-\\sqrt{11+k},k)$ and $(4+\\sqrt{11+k},k)$.\n Now, we know the triangle is equilateral. Since two vertices are on the same horizontal line, the side length is the difference of their $x$-coordinates, which is $(4+\\sqrt{11+k})-(4-\\sqrt{11+k})=2\\sqrt{11+k}$.\n The height of the equilateral triangle is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ times the side length, which is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}(2\\sqrt{11+k})=\\sqrt{3(11+k)}$. But the height is also the difference in the $y$-coordinate between the vertex and the horizontal side which is at $y=k$.\n This means the height is equal to $k-(-11)=k+11$, since $-11$ is the $y$-coordinate of the vertex. These heights must be equal, so we can write the equation \\begin{align} \\sqrt{3(11+k)}&=k+11\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n 3(11+k)&=(k+11)^2\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\ 33+3k&=k^2+22k+121\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\ 0&=k^2+19k+88\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\ 0&=(k+8)(k+11). \\end{align}Thus we have $k=-8$ or $k=-11$.\n We can throw out $k=-11$ because then the line $y=-11$ intersects the parabola only once, at the vertex, so there's no triangle, just a point.\n Thus we have $k=\\boxed{-8}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes x y k :: real\nassumes h0 : \"y = x powr 2 - 8 * x + 5\"\nand h1 : \"equilateral_triangle x y k\"\nand h2 : \"vertex_parabola x y\"\nshows  \"k = -8\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
