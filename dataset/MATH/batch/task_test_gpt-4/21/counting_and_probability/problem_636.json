What is the probability that either exactly 3 of the pieces of fruit are oranges or exactly 6 of the pieces of fruit are apples? The final Answer is \\dfrac{1904}{6561}\n ### Proof\n It is impossible for Pat to select both 3 oranges and 6 apples, so we can calculate the probabilities of these mutually exclusive cases separately and then add to get our final answer. The probability that 3 particular pieces of fruit will be oranges and the rest will not be is given by $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)^3\\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^5=\\dfrac{32}{6561}$, and there are $\\binom{8}{3}=56$ ways of selecting three pieces of fruit to be the oranges so the probability that 3 will be oranges is $56\\cdot\\dfrac{32}{6561}=\\dfrac{1792}{6561}$.\n Similarly, the probability that 6 particular pieces of fruit will be apples and the other two won't be is given by $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)^6\\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{4}{6561}$ and there are $\\binom{8}{6}=28$ ways of selecting which ones will be the apples, so multiplying again gives us a probability of $28\\cdot\\dfrac{4}{6561}=\\dfrac{112}{6561}$.\n Adding those two probabilities give us our final answer: $\\dfrac{1792}{6561}+\\dfrac{112}{6561}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1904}{6561}}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes oranges apples bananas :: nat\nassumes h0 : \"oranges + apples + bananas = 8\"\nand h1 : \"probability (\\<lambda>x. x = 3) oranges + probability (\\<lambda>x. x = 6) apples = 1904 / 6561\"\nshows  \"probability (\\<lambda>x.
