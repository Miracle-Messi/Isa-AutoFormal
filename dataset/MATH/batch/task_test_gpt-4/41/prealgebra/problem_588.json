Today, 36 of them brought yoga mats, 26 of them brought eco-friendly water bottles, and 20 of them remembered to bring both yoga mats and water bottles.  How many people had to suffer through class having neither a yoga mat nor a water bottle? The final Answer is 0\n ### Proof\n We can solve this with a Venn diagram. First we notice that there are 20 people with both yoga mats and water bottles.
