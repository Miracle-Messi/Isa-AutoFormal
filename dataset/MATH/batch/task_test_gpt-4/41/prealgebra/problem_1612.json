How many of the cars are 4-door and red? The final Answer is 3\n ### Proof\n Let the number of red 4-door cars be $x$. Since $\\frac13$ of the cars are red, there are $\\frac13\\cdot 30 = 10$ red cars, so there are $10 -x$ red 2-door cars. There are $(50\\%)\\cdot 30 = (0.5)(30) = 15$ cars that are 4-door cars, so $15-x$ of the 4-door cars are not red.\n We then have the following Venn diagram: [asy] unitsize(0.05cm); label(\"Red cars\", (2,74)); label(\"4-door cars\", (80,74)); draw(Circle((30,45), 22)); draw(Circle((58, 45), 22)); label(\"White 2-door cars: 8\",(44,10));\n label(\"$x$\", (44, 45)); label(scale(0.8)*\"$10-x$\",(28,58)); label(scale(0.8)*\"$15-x$\",(63,58)); [/asy]\n Adding all four categories, we have  \\[(10-x)+x+(15-x) + 8 = 30.\\]Simplifying gives $33-x = 30$, so $x = \\boxed{3}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes cars red_cars white_cars two_door four_door :: nat\nassumes h0 : \"cars = 30\"\nand h1 : \"red_cars = cars div 3\"\nand h2 : \"four_door = cars div 2\"\nand h3 : \"white_cars = cars - red_cars\"\nand h4 : \"two_door = 8\"\nshows  \"red_cars * four_door = 3\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
