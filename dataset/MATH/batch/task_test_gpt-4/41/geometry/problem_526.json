Since the ratio of side lengths between these two triangles is $1:2$, then the ratio of areas is $1:2^2=1:4$.\n Thus, the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $4 \\times 2 = \\boxed{8}\\mbox{ cm}^2$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes A B C M N P :: \"real^2\" and area :: \"real^2 \\<Rightarrow> real^2 \\<Rightarrow> real^2 \\<Rightarrow> real\"\nassumes h0 : \"B = midpoint C M\"\nand h1 : \"A = midpoint C N\"\nand h2 : \"P = midpoint A B\"\nand h3 : \"is_right_angle A C B\"\nand h4 : \"area A P N = 2\"\nshows  \"area A B C = 8\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
