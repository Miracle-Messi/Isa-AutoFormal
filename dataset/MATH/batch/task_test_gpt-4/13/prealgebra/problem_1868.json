Through $P,$ draw a line parallel to $DC$ as shown. The points $X$ and $Y$ are where this line meets $AD$ and $BC.$ From this, we see that $$AX=BY=15-3=12.$$ Also, $PY=14-5=9.$\n [asy] draw((0,0)--(14,0)--(14,15)--(5,3)--(0,15)--cycle,black+linewidth(1)); draw((0,3)--(5,3)--(5,0),black+linewidth(1)+dashed); draw((0,-3)--(6,-3),black+linewidth(1)); draw((8,-3)--(14,-3),black+linewidth(1));\n draw((0,-3.5)--(0,-2.5),black+linewidth(1)); draw((14,-3.5)--(14,-2.5),black+linewidth(1)); draw((0,0)--(1,0)--(1,1)--(0,1)--cycle,black+linewidth(1)); draw((14,0)--(14,1)--(13,1)--(13,0)--cycle,black+linewidth(1));\n label(\"$P$\",(5,3),3N); label(\"5\",(0,3)--(5,3),N); label(\"3\",(5,0)--(5,3),E); label(\"14\",(7,-3)); draw((5,3)--(14,3),black+linewidth(1)+dashed); label(\"$A$\",(0,15),NW); label(\"$B$\",(14,15),NE); label(\"$C$\",(14,0),SE);\n label(\"$D$\",(0,0),SW); label(\"$X$\",(0,3),W); label(\"$Y$\",(14,3),E); label(\"3\",(0,0)--(0,3),W); label(\"3\",(14,0)--(14,3),E); label(\"9\",(5,3)--(14,3),N); label(\"12\",(0,3)--(0,15),W); label(\"12\",(14,3)--(14,15),E);\n [/asy]\n To calculate the length of the rope, we need to calculate $AP$ and $BP,$ each of which is the hypotenuse of a right triangle.\n Now, $$AP^2=12^2+5^2=169$$ so $AP=13,$ and $$BP^2=12^2+9^2 = 225,$$ so $BP=15.$ Therefore, the required length of rope is $13+15$ or $\\boxed{28}\\text{ m}.$\n *)\n\n\n\nfun slackrope_length :: \"real \\<Rightarrow> real \\<Rightarrow> real \\<Rightarrow> real \\<Rightarrow> real\" where\n\"slackrope_length a b c d = sqrt (a^2 + b^2) + sqrt ((c-a)^2 + (d-b)^2)\"\n\ntheorem slackrope_28:\n  \"slackrope_length 3 5 15 14 = 28\"\n```\n\nHere, `a` and `b` represent the coordinates of the point where Paul is standing on the rope, `c` and `d` represent the height of the pole and the distance between the poles, and `slackrope_length` calculates the length of the rope as the sum of the distances from Paul to each pole. The theorem `slackrope_28` then asserts that when these parameters are set to the values given in the problem, the length of the rope is 28. \n\nPlease note that this is an indirect representation of the problem and may not capture all its aspects. In particular, the function `slackrope_length` is a simplification of the actual geometry involved in the problem.\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "Paul is standing on a slackrope. The rope is attached to two poles. The first pole is located at coordinates (3,5) and the second pole's height and horizontal distance from the first pole are represented by (15,14). Calculate the total length of the slackrope, which is the sum of the distances from Paul to each pole. The final answer is 28 units."
