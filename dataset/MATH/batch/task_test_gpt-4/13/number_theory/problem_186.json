Then \\[x^2 = 100a^2 + 20ab + b^2.\\]Since the older brother was the last brother to receive a whole payment of $\\$10$, the tens digit of $x^2$ must be odd.\n The tens digit of $100a^2$ is 0, and the tens digit of $20ab$ is even, so for the tens digit of \\[x^2 = 100a^2 + 20ab + b^2\\]to be odd, the tens digit of $b^2$ must be odd.\n We know that $b$ is a digit from 0 to 9. Checking these digits, we find that the tens digit of $b^2$ is odd only for $b = 4$ and $b = 6$.\n We also see that the units digit of $x^2$ is the same as the units digit of $b^2$. For both $b = 4$ and $b = 6$, the units digit of $b^2$ is 6.\n Therefore, the last payment to the younger brother was $\\boxed{6}$ dollars.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes x y :: real\nassumes h0 : \"x * x = y\"\nand h1 : \"y mod 20 < 10\"\nshows  \"y mod 20 = 6\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "Given that $x^2 = y$ and the remainder when $y$ is divided by $20$ is less than $10$, find the remainder when $y$ is divided by $20$. The final answer is $6$."
