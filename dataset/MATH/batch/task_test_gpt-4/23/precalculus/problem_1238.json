Finally, three red circles are drawn, so that each red circle is externally tangent to two unit circles and externally tangent to the blue circle.  Then the radius of each red circle can be expressed in the form\n\\[\\frac{a - b \\sqrt{c}}{d},\\]where $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d$ are positive integers, when simplified.  Find $a + b + c + d$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(2 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D, E, F, O;\nreal s = 2/sqrt(3) - 1, r = (9 - 4*sqrt(3))/33;\n\nA = 2/sqrt(3)*dir(150);\nB = 2/sqrt(3)*dir(30);\nC = 2/sqrt(3)*dir(270);\nO = (0,0);\nD = (r + s)*dir(330);\nE = (r + s)*dir(210);\nF = (r + s)*dir(90);\n\nfilldraw(Circle(O,s),blue);\nfilldraw(Circle(D,r),red);\nfilldraw(Circle(E,r),red);\nfilldraw(Circle(F,r),red);\ndraw(Circle(A,1));\ndraw(Circle(B,1));\ndraw(Circle(C,1));\n[/asy] The final Answer is 49\n ### Proof\n Let $A,$ $B,$ and $C$ be the centers of the unit circles, let $O$ be the center of the blue circle, and let $F$ be the center of the red circle that is tangent to the unit circles centered at $A$ and $B.$\n Since $AB = AC = BC = 2,$ triangle $ABC$ is equilateral, and $O$ is its center.\n By the Law of Sines on Triangle $ABO$, \\[\\frac{AO}{\\sin 30^\\circ} = \\frac{AB}{\\sin 120^\\circ},\\]so \\[AO = \\frac{AB \\sin 30^\\circ}{\\sin 120^\\circ} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{2 \\sqrt{3}}{3}.\\]The radius of the blue circle is then\n \\[s = AO - 1 = \\frac{2 \\sqrt{3}}{3} - 1 = \\frac{2 \\sqrt{3} - 3}{3}.\\][asy] unitsize(5 cm); pair A, B, C, D, E, F, O; real s = 2/sqrt(3) - 1, r = (9 - 4*sqrt(3))/33; A = 2/sqrt(3)*dir(150); B = 2/sqrt(3)*dir(30);\n C = 2/sqrt(3)*dir(270); O = (0,0); D = (r + s)*dir(330); E = (r + s)*dir(210); F = (r + s)*dir(90); draw(Circle(F,r),red); draw(Circle(O,s),blue); draw(A--B--F--cycle); draw(A--F--B); draw(A--O--B); draw(O--F);\n draw(arc(A,1,310,380)); draw(arc(B,1,160,230)); label(\"$A$\", A, W); label(\"$B$\", B, dir(0)); label(\"$F$\", F, N, UnFill); label(\"$O$\", O, S); [/asy]\n Let $r$ be the radius of the red circle.\n We see that $\\angle AOF = 60^\\circ,$ so by the Law of Cosines on triangle $AOF,$ \\[AF^2 = AO^2 - AO \\cdot OF + OF^2,\\]so \\[(1 + r)^2 = \\frac{4}{3} - \\frac{2 \\sqrt{3}}{3} \\cdot (r + s) + (r + s)^2.\\]We can isolate $r$ to get\n \\[r = \\frac{3s^2 \\sqrt{3} - 6s + \\sqrt{3}}{6 + 6 \\sqrt{3} - 6s \\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{3 (\\frac{2 \\sqrt{3} - 3}{3})^2 \\sqrt{3} - 6 \\cdot \\frac{2 \\sqrt{3} - 3}{3} + \\sqrt{3}}{6 + 6 \\sqrt{3} - 6 \\cdot \\frac{2 \\sqrt{3} - 3}{3} \\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{9 - 4 \\sqrt{3}}{33}.\\]The final answer is then $9 + 4 + 3 + 33 = \\boxed{49}.$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes s r a b c d :: real\nassumes h0 : \"s = 2 / sqrt 3 - 1\"\nand h1 : \"r = (9 - 4 * sqrt 3) / 33\"\nand h2 : \"a = 9\"\nand h3 : \"b = 4\"\nand h4 : \"c = 3\"\nand h5 : \"d = 33\"\nshows  \"a + b + c + d = 49\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
