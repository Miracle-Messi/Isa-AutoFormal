        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n Find all roots of the polynomial $x^4+2x^3-7x^2-8x+12$. Enter your answer as a list of numbers separated by commas. The final Answer is 1,2,-2,-3\n ### Proof\n By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root of the polynomial must be an integer, and divide $12$.\n Therefore, the integer roots are among the numbers $1,2,3,4,6,12$ and their negatives.\n We can start by trying $x=1$, which gives $$1+2-7-8+12=0.$$Hence, $1$ is a root!\n By the factor theorem, this means $x-1$ must be a factor of the polynomial.\n We can divide (using long division or synthetic division) to get $x^4+2x^3-7x^2-8x+12 = (x-1)(x^3+3x^2-4x-12)$.\n Now the remaining roots of our original polynomial are the roots of $x^3+3x^2-4x-12$, which has the same constant factor so we have the same remaining possibilities for roots.\n We can keep trying from the remaining 11 possibilities for factors of $12$ to find that $x=2$ gives us $$2^3+3\\cdot2^2-4\\cdot2-12 = 8+12-8-12=0.$$Therefore $2$ is a root and again the factor theorem tells us that $x-2$ must be a factor of the polynomial.\n Dividing $x^3+3x^2-4x-12$ by $x-2$ gives us $x^3+3x^2-4x-12 = (x-2)(x^2+5x+6)$.\n We can factorise $x^2+5x+6$ as $(x+2)(x+3)$ which gives us our last two roots of $-3$ and $-2$ (both of which divide $12$).\n Thus our roots are $\\boxed{1,2,-2,-3}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes x :: real\nassumes h0 : \"x powr 4 + 2 * x powr 3 - 7 * x powr 2 - 8 * x + 12 = 0\"\nshows  \"x = 1 \\<or> x = 2 \\<or> x = -2 \\<or> x = -3\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
