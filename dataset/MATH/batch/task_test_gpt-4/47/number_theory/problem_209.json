The final Answer is 30\n ### Proof\n We could use long division to find the decimal representations of the three fractions, but there's a slicker way.\n We begin by finding an equivalent fraction whose denominator is 1 less than a power of 10. Take $\\frac{3}{11}$, for example.\n We can multiply the numerator and denominator by 9 to rewrite this number as $\\frac{27}{99}$.\n Now, we can rewrite this fraction as $0.\\overline{27}$.\n To see why, let $x=0.\\overline{27}$, and subtract $x$ from $100x$: $$\\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l} &100x &=& 27&.272727\\ldots \\\\ - &x &=& 0&.272727\\ldots \\\\ \\hline &99x &=& 27 & \\end{array}$$ This shows that $0.\\overline{27} = \\frac{27}{99}$.\n We can apply the same trick to our other fractions.

That means the seventh digit will be a 9 (same as the first digit after the decimal point) and there is nothing carried over to affect the sixth digit.\n So, the sum $a+b+c+d+e+f$ is $9+3+6+3+9+0=\\boxed{30}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes a b c d e f :: real\nassumes h0 : \"4 / 37 + 3 / 11 + 23 / 9 = 2 + a / 10^1 + b / 10^2 + c / 10^3 + d / 10^4 + e / 10^5 + f / 10^6\"\nshows  \"a + b + c + d + e + f = 30\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
