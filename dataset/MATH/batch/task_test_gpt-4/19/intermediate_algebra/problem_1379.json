Then we can write \\[f(x) = k(x-a)(x-b)\\]for some integer $k$. Setting $x=0$, we get \\[2010 = kab.\\]Since $2010 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 67$, there are $3^4$ possible ways to assign the prime factors of $2010$ to $a$, $b$, and $k$; then there are four choices for the signs of $a$, $b$, and $k$ (either all positive, or two negative and one positive), giving $3^4 \\cdot 4 = 324$ triples total.\n Two of these triples have $a = b$ (namely, $a = b = 1$ and $k = 2010$, and $a = b = -1$ and $k = 2010$). Of the other $324 - 2 = 322$, we must divide by $2$ because the order of $a$ and $b$ does not matter.\n Therefore, the final count is \\[2 + \\frac{322}{2} = \\boxed{163}.\\]\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes f :: \"int \\<Rightarrow> int\"\nassumes h0 : \"degree (f x) = 2\"\nand h1 : \"\\<forall> x. is_int (f x)\"\nand h2 : \"f 0 = 2010\"\nand h3 : \"\\<exists> a b. a \\<in> Ints \\<and> b \\<in> Ints \\<and> poly_roots (f x) = {a, b}\"\nshows  \"card {f. \\<exists> a b. a \\<in> Ints \\<and> b \\<in> Ints \\<and> poly_roots (f x) = {a, b}} = 163\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
