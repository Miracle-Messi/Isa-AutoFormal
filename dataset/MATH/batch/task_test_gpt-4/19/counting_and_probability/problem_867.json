        "informal problem": "A phone number has the \"phone number property\" if its first three digits, called the prefix, are equal to the product of its four digits. For example, 336 has the phone number property because 3 * 3 * 6 = 336. The prefix of a phone number is 336, and there are 7 * 6 * 2 * 4 possible suffixes (the remaining four digits). How many phone numbers have the phone number property? The final answer is 84."
