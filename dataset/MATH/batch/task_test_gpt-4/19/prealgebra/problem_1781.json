Recall that $10^n$ has $n$ zeroes at the end of it.\n We must start with parentheses first. Recall that $\\left( a^m \\right) ^n = a^{mn}$. Because of this, we can rewrite the last term as $10^{15 \\cdot 4}=10^{60}$. Finally, recall the rules of division and multiplication of exponents: $a^m \\cdot a^n = a^{m+n}$ and $a^m \\div a^n = a^{m-n}$.\n Using these we can carry out the multiplication and division from left to right to get \\begin{align} (10^5 \\cdot 10^{77} \\div 10^{15}) \\div \\left(10^{15}\\right)^4 &= (10^5 \\cdot 10^{77} \\div 10^{15}) \\div 10^{60} \\\\\n &=(10^{5+77} \\div 10^{15}) \\div 10^{60} \\\\ &=(10^{82} \\div 10^{15} )\\div 10^{60} \\\\ &=10^{82-15} \\div 10^{60} \\\\ &=10^{67} \\div 10^{60} \\\\ &=10^{67-60} \\\\ &=10^7. \\end{align}Because the exponent of the number 10 is 7, this number has $\\boxed{7}$ zeroes at the end.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes x :: real\nassumes h0 : \"x = (10 powr 5 * 10 powr 77 / 10 powr 15) / (10 powr 15) powr 4\"\nshows  \"trailing_zeros x = 7\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
