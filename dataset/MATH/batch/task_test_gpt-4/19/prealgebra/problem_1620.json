Then the area of the large square is $1$. The triangular area $Q$ has base $1$ and height $\\frac{1}{2}$ and thus has an area of $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 1\\cdot \\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{4}$.\n Thus the percentage is $\\frac{\\frac{1}{4}}{1}=\\boxed{25\\%}$.\n *)\n\nThis problem involves a diagram that cannot be represented in Isabelle.
