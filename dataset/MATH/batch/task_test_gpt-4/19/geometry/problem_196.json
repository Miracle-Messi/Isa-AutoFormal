This area is obtained by subtracting the area of the segment of the circle bounded by the chord from the total area of the circle. The area of the segment is calculated as the difference between the area of the sector and the area of the triangle formed by the chord and the radii to its endpoints. The area of the sector is obtained by multiplying the square of the radius by the cosine of half the angle subtended by the chord at the circle's center, while the area of the triangle is obtained by multiplying half the length of the chord by the square root of the difference between four times the square of the radius and the square of the chord length.
