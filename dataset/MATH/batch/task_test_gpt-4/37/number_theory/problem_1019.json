The final Answer is 10\n ### Proof\n Jan steps on step number $s$ if $13\\leq s \\leq 130$ and $s$ leaves a remainder of $1$ when divided by $3$. Jen steps on step number $s$ if $3\\leq s \\leq 139$ and $s$ leaves a remainder of $3$ when divided by $4$.\n Therefore, we are counting the number of integers between $13$ and $130$ which leave a remainder of $1$ when divided by $3$ and a remainder of $3$ when divided by $4$.\n Let's check the remainders of Jan's first few steps when divided by 4. \\[ 13 \\rightarrow 1 \\] \\[ 16 \\rightarrow 0 \\] \\[ 19 \\rightarrow 3 \\] \\[ 22 \\rightarrow 2 \\] \\[ 25 \\rightarrow 1 \\] \\[ \\vdots \\] We see that the remainders of Jan's steps when divided by 4 cycle through the list $1,0,3,2$.\n Therefore, only every fourth step that Jan steps on will also be stepped on by Jen, so we are counting the number of elements in $\\{19,31,43,\\ldots,127\\}$. Writing this list in the form  \\[\\{19+0\\cdot12,19+1\\cdot12,19+2\\cdot12,\\ldots,19+9\\cdot12\\},\\] we see that $\\boxed{10}$ steps are stepped on by both Jen and Jan.\n Note: This problem is essentially an application of the Chinese Remainder Theorem.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes Jan_steps Jen_steps :: \"nat set\"\nassumes h0 : \"Jan_steps = {x. x \\<in> {13..130} \\<and> ((130 - x) mod 3 = 0)}\"\nand h1 : \"Jen_steps = {x. x \\<in> {3..139} \\<and> ((x - 3) mod 4 = 0)}\"\nshows  \"card (Jan_steps \\<inter> Jen_steps) = 10\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
