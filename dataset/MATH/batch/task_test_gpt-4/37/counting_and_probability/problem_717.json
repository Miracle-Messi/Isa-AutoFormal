Express your answer as a common fraction. The final Answer is \\dfrac{5}{12}\n ### Proof\n The probability that both $a$ and $b$ are positive is $\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)=\\frac{1}{6}$. The probability that $a$ and $b$ are both negative is $\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)=\\frac{1}{4}$.\n Since $ab$ is positive if and only if one of these two events occur, the probability that $ab$ is positive is $\\dfrac{1}{6}+\\dfrac{1}{4}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{12}}$.
