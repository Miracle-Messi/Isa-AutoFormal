        "informal problem": "In a survey, 100 people were asked which sport they prefer: basketball, football, hockey, or other. The number of people who prefer basketball is three times the number of people who prefer other sports. The number of people who prefer football is 10 more than the number of people who prefer hockey. Additionally, the number of people who prefer basketball and football together make up 65% of the total. How many people prefer basketball? The final answer is 30."
