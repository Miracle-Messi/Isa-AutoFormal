        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n Find the equation of the directrix of the parabola $y = x^2.$ The final Answer is y = -\\frac{1}{4}\n ### Proof\n Recall that a parabola is defined as the set of all points that are equidistant to the focus $F$ and the directrix. Since the parabola $y = x^2$ is symmetric about the $y$-axis, the focus is at a point of the form $(0,f).$  Let $y = d$ be the equation of the directrix.\n [asy] unitsize(1.5 cm); pair F, P, Q; F = (0,1/4); P = (1,1); Q = (1,-1/4); real parab (real x) {   return(x^2); } draw(graph(parab,-1.5,1.5),red); draw((-1.5,-1/4)--(1.5,-1/4),dashed); draw(P--F); draw(P--Q);\n dot(\"$F$\", F, NW); dot(\"$P$\", P, E); dot(\"$Q$\", Q, S); [/asy]\n Let $(x,x^2)$ be a point on the parabola $y = x^2.$  Then \\[PF^2 = x^2 + (x^2 - f)^2\\]and $PQ^2 = (x^2 - d)^2.$  Thus, \\[x^2 + (x^2 - f)^2 = (x^2 - d)^2.\\]Expanding, we get \\[x^2 + x^4 - 2fx^2 + f^2 = x^4 - 2dx^2 + d^2.\\]Matching coefficients, we get\n \\begin{align} 1 - 2f &= -2d, \\\\ f^2 &= d^2. \\end{align}From the first equation, $f - d = \\frac{1}{2}.$  Since $f^2 = d^2,$ $f = d$ or $f = -d.$  We cannot have $f = d,$ so $f = -d.$  Then $-2d = \\frac{1}{2},$ so $d = -\\frac{1}{4}.$\n Thus, the equation of the directrix is $\\boxed{y = -\\frac{1}{4}}.$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes x y :: real and f :: \"real \\<Rightarrow> real\"\nassumes h0 : \"\\<forall> x. f x = x powr 2\"\nand h1 : \"parabola f\"\nshows  \"directrix f = -1 / 4\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
