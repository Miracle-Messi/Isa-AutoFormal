Calling the center of the base $D$, we apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle $ABD$ to get \\[AB=\\sqrt{h^2+(s/2)^2}=\\sqrt{h^2+s^2/4}=\\sqrt{30^2+6396/4}=\\sqrt{2499},\\] which is closer to $\\sqrt{2500}=\\boxed{50}$ meters than to $\\sqrt{2401}=49$ meters, since $49.5^2=2450.25$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes V h l :: real\nassumes h0 : \"V = 63960\"\nand h1 : \"h = 30\"\nand h2 : \"V = (1/3) * powr h 2 * l\"\nshows  \"l = 50\" (* length of the lateral height in meters *)\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
