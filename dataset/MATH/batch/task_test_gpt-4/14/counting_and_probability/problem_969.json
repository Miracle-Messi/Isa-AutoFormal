The final Answer is \\frac{\\pi}{4}\n ### Proof\n We let the two numbers be $x$ and $y$. The set of all possible pairs $(x,y)$ satisfy the inequalities $0<x<2$ and $0<y<2$; we can graph these points as a square on the $x-y$ plane with vertices $(0,0),(2,0),(2,2)$ and $(0,2)$.\n This square has area $4.$ [asy] unitsize(1.5 cm); filldraw(arc((0,0),2,0,90)--(0,0)--cycle,gray(0.7)); draw((0,0)--(2,0)--(2,2)--(0,2)--cycle); label(\"$0$\", (0,0), S); label(\"$2$\", (2,0), S); label(\"$x$\", (2,0), E);\n label(\"$0$\", (0,0), W); label(\"$2$\", (0,2), W); label(\"$y$\", (0,2), N); [/asy]\n We want to find the area of the set of points which also satisfies $x^2+y^2\\le 4$. The set of ordered pairs that satisfy this inequality is a circle with radius $2$ centered at the origin. The overlap between the circle and the square is the quarter-circle in the first quadrant with radius $2.$  This region has area $\\frac{1}{4}(2)^2 \\pi = \\pi$.\n Thus, the desired probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{4}}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes x y :: real\nassumes h0 : \"0 \\<le> x\"\nand h1 : \"x \\<le> 2\"\nand h2 : \"0 \\<le> y\"\nand h3 : \"y \\<le> 2\"\nand h4 : \"x powr 2 + y powr 2 \\<le> 4\"\nshows  \"P {x, y} = pi / 4\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
