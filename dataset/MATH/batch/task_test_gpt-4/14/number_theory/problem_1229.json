        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n What is the residue modulo $16$ of the sum of the modulo $16$ inverses of the first $8$ positive odd integers?\n\nExpress your answer as an integer from $0$ to $15$, inclusive. The final Answer is 0\n ### Proof\n Since $16$ is even and only has a prime factor of $2$, all of the odd numbers are relatively prime with $16$ and their modular inverses exist. Furthermore, the inverses must be distinct: suppose that $a^{-1} \\equiv b^{-1} \\pmod{16}$.\n Then, we can multiply both sides of the congruence by $ab$ to obtain that $b \\equiv ab \\cdot a^{-1} \\equiv ab \\cdot b^{-1} \\equiv a \\pmod{16}$. Also, the modular inverse of an odd integer $\\mod{16}$ must also be odd: if the modular inverse of $m$ was of the form $2n$, then $2mn = 16k + 1$, but the left-hand side is even and the right-hand side is odd.\n Thus, the set of the inverses of the first $8$ positive odd integers is simply a permutation of the first $8$ positive odd integers.

        "informal problem": "The function $f(n)$ is defined for all natural numbers $n$ between 1 and 8 (inclusive), and is equal to the remainder when $2n - 1$ is divided by 16. Moreover, the values of $f(n)$ for these $n$ are non-negative and less than 16. What is the remainder when the sum of $f(n)$ for all $n$ between 1 and 8 (inclusive) is divided by 16?
