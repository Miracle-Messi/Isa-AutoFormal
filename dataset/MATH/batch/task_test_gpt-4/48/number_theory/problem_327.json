        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n A palindrome is a number that reads the same forward and backward. The largest possible 4-digit palindrome in base 3 can be expressed as a 3-digit palindrome in another base $b>2$. What is $b$? The final Answer is $6$\n ### Proof\n The largest possible 4-digit palindrome in base 3 is $2222_3=80_{10}$.\nWe know that converting $80_{10}$ to other bases will result in 3 digits when the base is from 5 to 8, inclusive, since $4^3<80<9^2$, meaning $1000_4<80<100_9$. Converting to other bases, we get $310_5, 212_6, 143_7, 120_8$.\nThe only palindrome is $212_6$, which is expressed in base $\\boxed{6}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes b :: nat\nassumes h0 : \"b > 2\"\nand h1 : \"\\<exists> n. n \\<in> {0..<3^4} \\<and> n = rev n \\<and> n = rev (n div b) \\<and> n div b \\<in> {0..<b^3}\"\nshows \"b = 6\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
