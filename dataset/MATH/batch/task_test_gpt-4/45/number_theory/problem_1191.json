If this were the case, then we could convert our fraction to $\\frac{k}{10}$, where $201k = n^2$, and $\\frac{k}{10}$ is clearly a terminating decimal.\n Conversely, no simplified terminating decimal has a factor of 3 or 67 in the denominator. It follows that if $n$ is not divisible by $3\\cdot 67$, then $n$ is a repeating decimal.\n Therefore, we need to compute the number of values of $n$ that yield squares which are not divisible by 3 and 67.\n However, $n^2$ is divisible by 3 and 67 if and only if $n$ must be divisible by 3 and 67.\n Therefore, $n$ cannot be divisible by $3 \\cdot 67=201$. There are $10$ multiplies of $201$ which are less than or equal to $2010$, so there are $2010 - 10 = \\boxed{2000}$ values of $n$ that yield a fraction $\\frac{n^2}{2010}$ which is a repeating decimal.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes n :: int and f :: \"int \\<Rightarrow> real\"\nassumes h0 : \"1 \\<le> n\"\nand h1 : \"n \\<le> 2010\"\nand h2 : \"\\<forall> n. f n = (n powr 2) / 2010\"\nand h3 : \"repeating_decimal (f n)\"\nshows  \"card {n. repeating_decimal (f n)} = 2000\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
