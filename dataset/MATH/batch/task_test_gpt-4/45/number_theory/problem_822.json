The final Answer is 4\n ### Proof\n Let the total sum be $S$. The number on each face is added to $S$ four separate times, since each face borders on $4$ vertices. There are $8$ vertices, and each is the sum of $3$ face numbers since each vertex borders $3$ faces.\n Thus $S$ is the sum of $8\\cdot 3=24$ face numbers. Since each face is added $4$ times, and there are $6$ faces, we know none of the faces are repeated or left out and each is added exactly $4$ times,  so $S=4(\\text{sum of numbers on faces})$.\n Thus no matter what the sum of the numbers on the faces is, the total sum $S$ is always divisible by $\\boxed{4}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes cube :: \"(nat \\<Rightarrow> nat) \\<Rightarrow> nat\" and vertex :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> nat\" \nand faces :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> nat\"\nassumes h0 : \"\\<forall> f. cube f = (\\<Sum> v \\<in> {1..8}. vertex v)\"\nand h1 : \"\\<forall> v. vertex v = (\\<Sum> f \\<in> {1..3}. faces (f + 3*(v-1)))\"\nand h2 : \"\\<forall> f. faces f \\<in> {1..6}\"\nshows  \"\\<forall> f. cube f mod 4 = 0\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "Consider a cube where each vertex of the cube is associated with the sum of three faces. Each face has a value between 1 and 6 (inclusive). The value of the cube is calculated as the sum of the values of its eight vertices. Prove that the value of any such cube is always a multiple of 4."
