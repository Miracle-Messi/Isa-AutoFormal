Find all values of $m$ such that the foci both lie on the circle $x^2+y^2=16.$\n\nEnter all possible values of $m,$ separated by commas. The final Answer is \\frac{1}{5}, -\\frac{1}{3}\n ### Proof\n If $m > 0,$ then the graph of $x^2+my^2 = 4$ is an ellipse centered at the origin. The endpoints of the horizontal axis are $(\\pm 2,0),$ while the endpoints of the vertical axis are $\\left(0, \\pm \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{m}}\\right).$ If $m < 1,$ then the vertical axis is longer, so it is the major axis, and the distance from the foci to the origin is \\[\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{m}}\\right)^2 - 2^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4}{m} - 4}.\\]Since the foci lie on the circle $x^2+y^2=16,$ which has radius $4$ and is centered at the origin, we must have \\[\\sqrt{\\frac{4}{m}-4} = 4\\]which gives $m = \\frac{1}{5}.$ If $m>1,$ then the horizontal axis is longer, so it is the major axis.\n But the endpoints of the horizontal axis are $(\\pm 2, 0),$ so it is impossible that the foci of the ellipse are $4$ units away from the origin in this case. If $m<0,$ then the graph of $x^2+my^2 = 4$ is a hyperbola centered at the origin, with the vertices on the $x-$axis.\n Its standard form is \\[\\frac{x^2}{2^2} - \\frac{y^2}{\\left(\\sqrt{-\\frac {4}m}\\,\\right)^2} = 1,\\]so the distance from the foci to the origin is \\[\\sqrt{2^2 + \\left(\\sqrt{-\\frac {4}m}\\,\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{4 - \\frac{4}{m}}.\\]Therefore, we must have $\\sqrt{4 - \\frac{4}{m}} = 4,$ which gives $m=-\\frac{1}{3}.$\n Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are $m = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{5}, -\\frac{1}{3}}.$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes m :: real\nassumes h0 : \"m \\<noteq> 0\"\nand h1 : \"m \\<noteq> 1\"\nand h2 : \"x powr 2 + m * y powr 2 = 4\"\nand h3 : \"\\<exists> f1 f2. f1 \\<noteq> f2 \\<and> \n          dist (f1, (0,0)) = dist (f2, (0,0)) = sqrt 16 \\<and> \n          dist (f1, (x,y)) + dist (f2, (x,y)) = 2 * sqrt (4 + (m * y powr 2))\"\nshows  \"m = 1/5 \\<or> m = -1/3\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
