The precise translation into Isabelle would require a deep understanding of the problem, and it may not be straightforward to express this problem precisely in Isabelle syntax without the use of additional libraries or frameworks. However, a rough translation might look something like this:\n\n```\nfunction f :: \"real \\<Rightarrow> real\"\nwhere\n  \"x < floor x + 1 / floor x \\<Longrightarrow> f x = floor x * abs(x - floor x - 1 / (2 * floor x))\"\n| \"x \\<ge> floor x + 1 / floor x \\<Longrightarrow> f x = f(x - 1 / floor x)\"\nby(auto, metis less_le)\n\ndefinition g :: \"real \\<Rightarrow> real\"\nwhere\n\"g x = 2 powr (x - 2007)\"\n\ntheorem \nassumes h0 : \"\\<forall> x. x \\<ge> 1\"\nshows  \"card {x. f x = g x} = 4022030\"\n```\n\nThis Isabelle code attempts to define the functions `f` and `g` as given in the problem, and then states the desired result as a theorem. Note that the function `f` is defined recursively, which makes its definition in Isabelle more complex. Also, the theorem assumes that `x` is always greater than or equal to 1, as specified in the problem. It then asserts that the number of points where `f` and `g` intersect is equal to 4022030.\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "Consider a function $f(x)$ such that when $x$ is less than the floor of $x$ plus $1$ divided by the floor of $x$, $f(x)$ equals the product of the floor of $x$ and the absolute value of $x$ minus the floor of $x$ minus $1$ divided by twice the floor of $x$. On the other hand, when $x$ is greater than or equal to the floor of $x$ plus $1$ divided by the floor of $x$, $f(x)$ equals $f(x - 1/\\text{floor}(x))$.\n\nNow, consider another function $g(x) = 2^{(x - 2007)}$.\n\nThe problem is to find how many values of $x \\geq 1$ satisfy the equation $f(x) = g(x)$.
