The smallest square in the diagram is formed by connecting the midpoints of this square with area 8, so the smallest square has area $\\frac12 \\cdot 8 =4$ square inches, leaving $8-4=\\boxed{4}$ square inches of shaded area.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes side :: real\nassumes h0 : \"side = 4\"\nshows  \"let shaded_area = (side * side) / 2 in shaded_area = 4\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
