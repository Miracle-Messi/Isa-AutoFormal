        "informal problem": "Two natural numbers $a$ and $b$ add up to 13. The absolute difference between the number formed by concatenating $a$ and $b$ (as $10a + b$) and the number formed by concatenating $b$ and $a$ (as $10b + a$) is 27. Find the sum of the two concatenated numbers, i.e., find the value of $(10a + b) + (10b + a)$. The final answer is 143."
