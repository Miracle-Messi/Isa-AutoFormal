Isabelle is a theorem prover that deals with textual data and does not have the ability to interpret diagrams or images. \n\nHowever, if we can translate the problem statement into a condition on the variables $v$, $w$, $x$, $y$, and $z$, we can then express this as a theorem in Isabelle.\n\nFor example, if the condition is that the sum of the numbers in each row, column, and diagonal are equal, and the sum of the first row is 64 (assuming the values given in the problem), then we can express this as follows:\n\ntheorem\n  fixes v w x y z :: real\n  assumes h0 : \"v + 24 + w = 64\"\nand h1 : \"25 + z + 21 = 64\"\nand h2 : \"18 + x + y = 64\"\nshows  \"y + z = 46\" \n\nThis is a very rough translation and assumes that the sum of each row, column, and diagonal is 64, which is not given in the problem statement. The actual conditions of the problem would need to be translated into an equivalent mathematical condition to be expressed in Isabelle.\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
