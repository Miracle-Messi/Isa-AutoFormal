The final Answer is 32\n ### Proof\n We complete the square for the first equation by adding $(-24/2)^2$ and $(-32/2)^2$ to both sides, which gives \\[ (x^2-24x +144) +(y^2-32y +256)-16=0, \\] which is also equivalent to \\[ (x-12)^2 +(y-16)^2 =4^2.\n \\] Similarly, the equation for the second circle is \\[ (x+12)^2 +(y+16)^2 =4^2. \\] Hence, the centers of the circles are $(12,16)$ and $(-12,-16)$ respectively. Furthermore, the radii of the circles are equal to $4$.\n Now the distance between the points $(12,16)$ and $(-12,-16)$ by the distance formula or similarity of $3-4-5$ triangles is $40$.\n Therefore, to find the shortest distance between the two circles, we must subtract from $40$ the distances from the centers to the circles.\n Thus, the shortest distance between the circles is $40-4-4 = \\boxed{32}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes x y :: real and circle1 circle2 :: \"real \\<Rightarrow> real \\<Rightarrow> real\"\nassumes h0 : \"\\<forall> x y. circle1 x y = x powr 2 - 24 * x + y powr 2 - 32 * y + 384\"\nand h1 : \"\\<forall> x y. circle2 x y = x powr 2 + 24 * x + y powr 2 + 32 * y + 384\"\nand h2 : \"circle1 x y = 0\"\nand h3 : \"circle2 x y = 0\"\nshows  \"shortest_distance circle1 circle2 = 32\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
