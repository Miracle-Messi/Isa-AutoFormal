        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n A $\\textit{palindrome}$ is a positive integer which reads the same forward and backward, like $12321$ or $4884$.\n\nHow many $4$-digit palindromes are divisible by $3$? The final Answer is 30\n ### Proof\n Once we've picked the first two digits of a $4$-digit palindrome, the last two digits are automatically chosen by mirroring the first two.\n Thus, we can make exactly one $4$-digit palindrome for every $2$-digit number. For example, the $2$-digit number $57$ gives the palindrome $5775$. For an integer to be divisible by $3$, the sum of its digits must also be divisible by $3$.\n A $4$-digit palindrome has two identical pairs of digits. If the total of all four digits is a multiple of $3$, then the first two digits must also add up to a multiple of $3$ (since doubling a non-multiple of $3$ can't give us a multiple of $3$).\n Thus, to make a $4$-digit palindrome which is a multiple of $3$, we must use a $2$-digit number that is a multiple of $3$. This tells us that the number of $4$-digit palindromes that are divisible by $3$ is identical to the number of multiples of $3$ from $10$ through $99$.\n Here is a list of those multiples of $3$: $$12, 15, 18, 21, 24, \\ldots, 90, 93, 96, 99.$$ This list consists of the $30$ positive multiples of $3$ greater than $10.$ So, there are $30$ numbers in the list, and therefore $\\boxed{30}$ four-digit palindromes that are divisible by $3$.\n Here is a list of those palindromes: $$1221, 1551, 1881, 2112, 2442, \\ldots, 9009, 9339, 9669, 9999.$$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes palindrome :: \"int \\<Rightarrow> bool\"\nassumes h0 : \"\\<forall> n. palindrome n = (n > 999 \\<and> n < 10000 \\<and> n div 1000 = n mod 10 \\<and> (n div 100) mod 10 = (n div 10) mod 10)\"\nand h1 : \"\\<forall> n. palindrome n \\<longrightarrow> n mod 3 = 0\"\nshows  \"card {n. palindrome n} = 30\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
