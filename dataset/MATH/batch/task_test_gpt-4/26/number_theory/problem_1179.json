        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n A palindrome is a number that is the same when read forwards and backwards, such as $43234$. What is the smallest five-digit palindrome that is divisible by $11$? The final Answer is 10901\n ### Proof\n For an integer $abcde$ to be divisible by $11$ then $a-b+c-d+e$ is divisible by $11.$\n We start with the case where $(a+c+e)-(b+d) = 0.$ Then, $a+c+e=b+d.$ Since we have a palindrome, we must have $a = e$ and $b = d,$ meaning that $2a+c=2b.$ We must have that $a$ and $e$ must be at least $1,$ so then we can let $b$ and $d$ also be 1 and $c$ be zero.\n So the smallest such five-digit palindrome is $11011.$ Then, we investigate the case where $(a+c+e)-(b+d) = 11.$ Then, $a+c+e=b+d+11,$ and $a = e$ and $b = d,$ so  $2a + c = 11 + 2b.$ We see that we can let $a$ be 1 and $c$ be 9, then $b = 0,$ and we have the palindrome $10901.$\n Finally, $(a+c+e)-(b+d) = -11.$ Then, $2a + c = 2b - 11.$ We check if $a = 1$ has any solutions.\n We get $2 + c = 2b - 11,$ so $c - 2b = -9.$ Then, we can see that there are no solutions for $b = 0$, since then we would have $c = -9.$ Since we already found $10901,$ we do not need to check for any $b$ greater than $0$, so we see that our solution is $\\boxed{10901}.$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes palindrome :: int\nassumes h0 : \"\\<forall> n. palindrome n = reverse n\"\nand h1 : \"palindrome n = n\"\nand h2 : \"n >= 10000\"\nand h3 : \"n < 100000\"\nand h4 : \"n mod 11 = 0\"\nshows  \"n = 10901\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
