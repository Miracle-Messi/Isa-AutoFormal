The smallest possible value of such a sum is equal to $3 \\cdot 2 = 6$, and the largest possible value of such a sum is equal to $3 \\cdot 8 = 24$.\n After testing, we find that \\begin{align}6 = 2+2+2,\\ 8 = 4+2+2,\\ 10 = 4+4+2, \\\\ 12 = 4+4+4,\\ 14 = 8+4+2,\\ 16 = 8+4+4, \\\\ 18 = 8+8+2,\\ 20 = 8+8+4,\\ 24 = 8+8+8.\\end{align} However, we cannot find a combination that will add to be $22$: if two of the numbers are not $8$, then the maximum possible sum is $4 + 4 + 8 = 16$.\n Thus, two of the numbers picked must be $8$, but then the third ball must have the number $6$, which is not possible.\n Thus, the answer is the sum of the even numbers from $6$ to $24$ excluding $22$, which is $\\boxed{128}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes pick_1 pick_2 pick_3 :: nat\nassumes h0 : \"pick_1 \\<in> {2, 4, 8}\"\nand h1 : \"pick_2 \\<in> {2, 4, 8}\"\nand h2 : \"pick_3 \\<in> {2, 4, 8}\"\nshows  \"sum_list [pick_1, pick_2, pick_3] \\<in> {6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 24}\"\nand \"sum (\\<lambda>x. x) {6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 24} = 128\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
