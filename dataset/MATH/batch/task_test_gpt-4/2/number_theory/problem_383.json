        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n What is the sum of all positive integers that have twice as many digits when written in base $2$ as they have when written in base $3$? Express your answer in base $10$. The final Answer is 10\n ### Proof\n First we consider integers that have $2$ digits in base $2$ and $1$ digit in base $3$. Such an integer must be greater than or equal to $10_2 = 2$, but strictly less than $10_3 = 3$. The only such integer is $2$.\n Next we consider integers that have $4$ digits in base $2$ and $2$ digits in base $3$. Such an integer must be greater than or equal to $1000_2 = 2^3$, but strictly less than $100_3 = 3^2$. The only such integer is $8$.\n Next we consider integers that have $6$ digits in base $2$ and $3$ digits in base $3$. Such an integer must be greater than or equal to $100000_2 = 2^5$, but strictly less than $1000_3 = 3^3$. There are no such integers, because $2^5 > 3^3$.\n If we continue in this fashion, we may come to suspect that there are no more solutions of any length.\n Let us prove this. If an integer $N$ has $2d$ digits in base $2$, then $N\\ge 2^{2d-1}$. But if $N$ has only $d$ digits in base $3$, then $N<3^d$. A mutual solution is possible only if $$2^{2d-1}<3^d.$$We can rearrange this inequality as $$\\left(\\frac 43\\right)^d < 2.$$By inspection, this inequality is valid for $d=1,2$ but invalid for $d=3$, and also invalid for any larger $d$ since the left side increases as $d$ increases.\n This shows that there are no solutions $N$ beyond those we found already: $2$ and $8$, whose sum is $\\boxed{10}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes n :: nat\nassumes h0 : \"\\<forall>n. size (digits 2 n) = 2 * size (digits 3 n)\"\nshows  \"sum id {n. n > 0 \\<and> size (digits 2 n) = 2 * size (digits 3 n)} = 10\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
