        "informal problem": "If the rainfall measurement is two-thirds of a given value and the snowfall measurement is three-fifths of a given value, compute the result when the snowfall function is applied four times to the rainfall function, starting with the value of 4, and when the rainfall function is applied five times to the snowfall function, also starting with the value of 4. The two results are equal and they are both 128/1875."
