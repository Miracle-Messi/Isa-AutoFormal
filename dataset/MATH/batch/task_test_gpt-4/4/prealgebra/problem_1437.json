Isabelle is a theorem prover, not a programming language, so it cannot directly solve this problem. However, you can define a predicate for palindromes and another one for divisibility by 3, and then state that the number of such numbers is 30. Here is a possible formalization:\n\n```\ndefinition is_palindrome :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> bool\" where\n\"is_palindrome n = (n = nat_of_rev_nat n)\"\n\ndefinition is_divisible_by_3 :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> bool\" where\n\"is_divisible_by_3 n = (n mod 3 = 0)\"\n\ndefinition count_3_digit_palindromes :: \"nat\" where\n\"count_3_digit_palindromes = card {n. 100 \\<le> n \\<and> n < 1000 \\<and> is_palindrome n \\<and> is_divisible_by_3 n}\"\n\ntheorem\nshows  \"count_3_digit_palindromes = 30\"\n```\n\nThe `nat_of_rev_nat` function, which is not standard in Isabelle, is supposed to return the number obtained by reversing the digits of the input number. It should be properly defined or replaced with an equivalent expression in Isabelle.\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
