The base of the triangle has length $x$.\n To find the altitude, we notice that drawing an altitude splits the equilateral triangle into two $30-60-90$ triangles with the longest side having length $x$. Since the ratio of the side lengths of a $30-60-90$ triangle is $1:\\sqrt{3}:2$, the altitude will have length $\\frac{x\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and the area of the triangle will be $\\frac{1}{2}x\\left(\\frac{x\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)=\\frac{x^2\\sqrt{3}}{4}$.\n Setting this equal to $16 \\sqrt{3}$, we have that $\\frac{x^2\\sqrt{3}}{4}=16\\sqrt{3}.$\n Solving for $x$, we get that $x=8$.
