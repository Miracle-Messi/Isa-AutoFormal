Then, $\\gcd(a,b) = 3$ and, without loss of generality, let $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = 12a$.\n Multiplying the two equations yields that $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] \\cdot \\gcd(a,b) = 36a$.\n Using the identity that $ab = \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] \\cdot \\gcd(a,b)$, it follows that $ab = 36a$, and so $b = 36$. Since $\\gcd(a,b) = 3$, we know $a$ is divisible by 3.\n However, $a$ cannot be divisible by $3^2 = 9$, because if $a$ was divisible by 9, then $\\gcd(a,b)$ would be divisible by 9 as well, since 36 is divisible by 9. This cannot occur since $\\gcd(a,b) = 3$.\n Similarly, $a$ cannot be divisible by 2, because if $a$ were divisible by 2, then $\\gcd(a,b)$ would be divisible by 2 as well, since 36 is divisible by 2. In summary, $a$ is a multiple of 3, but not 9, and $a$ is not divisible by 2.\n The largest such number less than 100 is 93.\n We can verify that $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[93,36] = 1116 = 12 \\cdot 93$, so the largest possible sum of $a + b$ is $36 + 93 = \\boxed{129}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes a b :: nat\nassumes h0 : \"a < 100 \\<and> b < 100\"\nand h1 : \"gcd a b = 3\"\nand h2 : \"lcm a b = 12 * a\"\nshows  \"a + b \\<le> 129\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
