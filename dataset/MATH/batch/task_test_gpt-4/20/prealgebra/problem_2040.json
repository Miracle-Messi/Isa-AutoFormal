The hour hand is a little trickier. If we divide $360^\\circ$ evenly among 12 hours, we get that each hour, the hour hand moves $\\frac{360^\\circ}{12}=30^\\circ$.\n Note that the hour hand is not at the 2 since it gradually moves toward the 3 throughout the hour.\n From the 2 toward the 3, the hour hand has moved $\\frac{48}{60}=\\frac{4}{5}$ of the way.\n So the degree measure of the hour hand is $2\\frac{4}{5}\\cdot30^\\circ=84^\\circ$.\n To find the smaller angle formed by the two hands, we can find the larger angle $288^\\circ-84^\\circ=204^\\circ$ and subtract from $360^\\circ$ to get $\\boxed{156^\\circ}$. Or we know that $84^\\circ$ is coterminal with (ends at the same place as) $84^\\circ+360^\\circ=444^\\circ$.\n Now we can subtract $444^\\circ-288^\\circ=\\boxed{156^\\circ}$ to find the smaller angle.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes hour minute :: real\nassumes h0 : \"hour = 2 + 48 / 60\"\nand h1 : \"minute = 48\"\nand h2 : \"hour = minute / 12\"\nshows  \"abs (360 * (hour - minute) / 12) = 156\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
        "informal problem": "When the time is 2 hours and 48 minutes, what is the absolute value of the angle (in degrees) between the hour and the minute hand on a 12-hour analog clock? The final answer is 156 degrees."
