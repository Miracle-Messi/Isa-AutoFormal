The final Answer is -3(x+2)(x-1)\n ### Proof\n Since the graph has no horizontal asymptote, $q(x)$ must have degree less than $3.$ We can factor the numerator of our given function as $4x-x^3 = x(2+x)(2-x).$ Then, since the graph has a hole at $x=-2,$ then $q(x)$ must have a factor of $x+2.$\n Since the graph has a vertical asymptote at $x=1,$ it must have a factor of $x-1.$ Hence, $q(x) = a(x+2)(x-1)$ for some constant $a.$\n We know $q(3) = -30.$ Then, $a(3+2)(3-1) = -30,$ which we can solve to get $a=-3.$ Thus, $q(x) = \\boxed{-3(x+2)(x-1)} = -3x^2-3x+6.$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes x q :: \"real \\<Rightarrow> real\"\nassumes h0 : \"q x = -3 * (x + 2) * (x - 1)\"\nand h1 : \"\\<forall> x. q x \\<noteq> 0\"\nand h2 : \"\\<exists> x. x = -2\"\nand h3 : \"\\<exists> x. x = 1\"\nand h4 : \"\\<not>(\\<exists> x. lim (x powr 3 - 4 * x / q x) x = \\<infinity>)\"\nand h5 : \"q 3 = -30\"\nshows  \"q x = -3 * (x + 2) * (x - 1)\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
