        "formal solution": "(* ### Problem\n Let $p(x)$ be the second degree polynomial such that $p(1) = 1,$ $p(2) = 3,$ and $p(3) = 2.$  Then $p(p(x)) = x$ has four real solutions.  Find the only such solution which is not an integer. The final Answer is \\frac{8}{3}\n ### Proof\n Since \\begin{align} p(p(1)) &= p(1) = 1, \\\\ p(p(2)) &= p(3) = 2, \\\\ p(p(3)) &= p(2) = 3, \\end{align}three of the four solutions to $p(p(x))$ are $x = 1,$ 2, and 3. Also, the quadratic equation $p(x) = x$ has $x = 1$ as a root.\n Let $r$ be the other root. Then \\[p(p(r)) = p(r) = r,\\]so $r$ must be the fourth root we seek. Since $p(x) - x = 0$ for $x = 1$ and $x = r,$ \\[p(x) - x = c(x - 1)(x - r)\\]for some constant $c.$  Setting $x = 2$ and $x = 3,$ we get\n \\begin{align} 1 &= c(2 - r), \\\\ -1 &= 2c(3 - r). \\end{align}Dividing these equations, we get \\[-1 = \\frac{2(3 - r)}{2 - r}.\\]Solving for $r,$ we find $r = \\boxed{\\frac{8}{3}}.$\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes p :: \"real \\<Rightarrow> real\"\nassumes h0 : \"p 1 = 1\"\nand h1 : \"p 2 = 3\"\nand h2 : \"p 3 = 2\"\nand h3 : \"card {x. p (p x) = x} = 4\"\nand h4 : \"\\<exists>! x. p (p x) = x \\<and> x \\<notin> \\<int>\"\nshows  \"THE x. p (p x) = x \\<and> x \\<notin> \\<int> = 8 / 3\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
