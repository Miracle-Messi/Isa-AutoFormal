What was her average speed, in meters per second, for the $1600$ meter run?  Express your answer as an improper fraction. The final Answer is \\frac{160}{33}\n ### Proof\n The average speed is the total distance traveled, namely $1600\\ \\text{m}$, divided by the total time of the run. It took Melanie $\\frac{400}{5}=80$ seconds to run the first $400$ meters, $\\frac{800}{4}=200$ seconds to run the next $800$ meters, and $\\frac{400}{8}=50$ seconds to run the final $400$ meters.\n Thus the total time of her run was $80+200+50=330$ seconds, and so her average speed for the run was $\\frac{1600}{330}=\\boxed{\\frac{160}{33}}$ meters per second.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes s1 s2 s3 :: real\nassumes h0 : \"s1 = 5\"\nand h1 : \"s2 = 4\"\nand h2 : \"s3 = 8\"\nand h3 : \"400 / s1 + 800 / s2 + 400 / s3 = 1600 / (160 / 33)\"\nshows  \"160 / 33 = (400 / s1 + 800 / s2 + 400 / s3)\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
