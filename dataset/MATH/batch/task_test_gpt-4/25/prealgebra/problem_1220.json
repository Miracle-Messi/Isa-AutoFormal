The final Answer is 156^\\circ\n ### Proof\n [asy] unitsize(0.8inch); for (int i=0 ; i<=11 ;++i) { draw((rotate(i*30)*(0.8,0)) -- (rotate(i*30)*(1,0))); label(format(\"%d\",i+1),(rotate(60 - i*30)*(0.68,0))); } draw(Circle((0,0),1),linewidth(1.1));\n draw(rotate(162)*(0.7,0)--(0,0)--(rotate(6)*(0.5,0)),linewidth(1.2)); [/asy] There are 12 hours on a clock, so each hour mark is $360^\\circ/12 = 30^\\circ$ from its neighbors. At 2:48 the minute hand points at minute 48, which is $\\frac35$ of the way from hour 9 to hour 10.\n Therefore, the minute hand is $\\frac35\\cdot 30 = 18^\\circ$ past hour 9, which means it is $30^\\circ - 18^\\circ = 12^\\circ$ shy of hour 10. This means the minute hand is $2\\cdot 30^\\circ + 12^\\circ = 72^\\circ$ shy of hour 12.\n The hour hand is $\\frac{48}{60} = \\frac45$ of the way from hour 2 to hour 3, so it is $\\frac45\\cdot 30^\\circ = 24^\\circ$ past hour 2.\n So, the hour hand is $2\\cdot 30^\\circ + 24^\\circ = 84^\\circ$ past hour 12.\n Combining the angles between each hand and hour 12, the angle between the hands is $72^\\circ + 84^\\circ = \\boxed{156^\\circ}$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes degrees :: real\nassumes h0 : \"degrees = ((12 * 60 * 2 + 48) mod 720) / 2\"\nshows  \"degrees = 156\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
