Then $c_0=a_0+b_0=0+1=1$ and $c_1=a_1+b_1=1+2=3$. Additionally, for integers $n>1$ we have \\begin{align}\n c_n&=a_n+b_n\\\\ &=(a_{n-1} +b_{n-2})+(a_{n-2} +b_{n-1})\\\\ &=(a_{n-2}+b_{n-2})+(a_{n-1}+b_{n-1})\\\\ &=c_{n-2}+c_{n-1}. \\end{align} This is convenient since we want to determine the remainder of $a_{50}+b_{50}=c_{50}$.\n Thus, we no longer have to think about the sequences $A$ and $B$, but only about $C$. The first few terms of $C$ are $1,3,4,7,11,18,29$.\n When reduced modulo $5$, these terms are $1,3,4,2,1,3,4$. The first four terms are $1,3,4,2$. These continue repeating $\\pmod 5$ because the next two terms are $1,3$ and all terms are defined as the sum of the preceding two.\n Since the cycle has length $4$ and $50\\equiv 2\\pmod 4$, we have $$c_{50} \\equiv c_2 \\pmod 5,$$ and thus $c_{50}\\equiv \\boxed{4}\\pmod 5$.\n *)\n\ntheorem\nfixes a b :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> nat\"\nassumes h0 : \"a 0 = 0\"\nand h1 : \"a 1 = 1\"\nand h2 : \"\\<forall> n \\<ge> 2. a n = a (n - 1) + b (n - 2)\"\nand h3 : \"b 0 = 1\"\nand h4 : \"b 1 = 2\"\nand h5 : \"\\<forall> n \\<ge> 2. b n = a (n - 2) + b (n - 1)\"\nshows  \"(a 50 + b 50) mod 5 = 4\"\n proof- \n  show ?thesis sledgehammer",
